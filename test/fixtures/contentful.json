To implement a referral program you need to develop a strategy for how and when a user will be identified to SaaSquatch.

When you \"Identify\" a user, you enroll them to be able to refer their friends and to track if they have been referred. For details on how referrals are tracked see [Attribution](/topics/attribution/) and [Conversion](/topics/conversion/)."

This usually involves a company providing information about the active user to Referral SaaSquatch using our REST API or Squatch.js, our javascript library. Here are a few examples of common ways that people identify users.\n\n - **eCommerce:** After someone completes a purchase, they visit a \"Thank You\" page. On this page, an ecommerce company loads Squatch.js to track the email address, user id and name of the person that just made a purchase. This identifying information is used to build a contact record in SaaSquatch so that this person that just purchased can make referrals, or if they were referred, so they can be [attributed as a referral](/topics/attribution) and [marked as converted](/topics/conversion).\n - **SaaS:** Identification usually happens by including Squatch.js on every page of your web application. After launching your referral program, then the first time someone signs into your product, they'll have their email address, user id and name synched with SaaSquatch. If someone has been referred, then this identifying information will be used to [attribute](/topics/attribution) any referrals that happened.\n - **Mobile:** Identification usually happens when someone signs up for a user account. When someone is created in the server database, it is also created as a record in the SaaSquatch database using the SaaSquatch REST API.\n\n\n### Accounts vs Users\n\nReferral SaaSquatch supports referral tracking for both B2B and B2C workflows by seperating an \"Account\" and a \"User\".\nUsers are for people. Accounts are for companies or groups. Users have individual contact records for a person with names, email addresses, profile pictures and share links. Accounts have \none or more users in them and have rewards and reward balances.

This can be achieved by following these steps:\n\n* Register our new user with Referral SaaSquatch.\n* Lookup a referral code provided by our user during sign up.\n* Apply the referral to our user's account.\n* Show our user some information about the user who referred them.\n\n#### Import Saasquatch\n\nImport the Saasquatch class at the top of your file.\n\n```swift\nimport saasquatch\n```\n\n#### Register a user with Referral SaaSquatch\n\nTo register a user, we provide user information to Referral SaaSquatch. We provide our tenant alias which identifies our app. A userId from our system is passed to SaaSquatch to uniquely identify our users. We pass in an accountId, which Referral SaaSquatch uses to group users together; see [Shared vs Solo Accounts](../../../shared-vs-solo-accounts/ \"Shared vs Solo Accounts\") to see what you should use here.\nLastly, we provide a valid JSON object containing information about our user. For a description of the available `userInfo` fields, please see [SaaSquatch docs](../../../api/methods/#open_create_user \"Referral SaaSquatch REST API reference\"). Here is an example:\n\n```swift\n// This is your tenant alias which identifies you with Referral SaaSquatch\nlet tenant = \"acpiocfij942\"\n\n// We register our user internally, then pass the user's information to Referral SaaSquatch\nlet userId = \"000001\"\nlet accountId = \"000001\"\n\nlet userInfo: [String: AnyObject] = [\n    \"id\": userId,\n    \"accountId\": accountId,\n    \"email\": \"claire@lallybroch.com\",\n    \"firstName\": \"Claire\",\n    \"lastName\": \"Fraser\",\n    \"locale\": \"en_US\",\n    \"referralCode\": \"CLAIREFRASER\"]\n```\n\nIn this example, we assign an id of 000001 since Claire is our first user. We pass her email, first and last names, and her locale to Referral SaaSquatch. We have also assigned her a referral code so she can use it to refer new users. When a new user signs up with referral code \"CLAIREFRASER\" she will get the credit.\n\nNow we can register our user with Referral SaaSquatch using this call:\n\n```swift\n\n// Register a user with Referral Saasquatch\nSaasquatch.registerUserForTenant(tenant, withUserID: userId, withAccountID: accountId, withToken: token, withUserInfo: userInfo,\n    completionHandler: {(userInfo: AnyObject?, error: NSError?) in\n\n\t    // Code to be executed after the async call returns\n})\n\n```\n\nWe provide a `completionHandler` which will be called with `userInfo` and `error`. `userInfo` contains the returned information about the user. `error` contains a description of the error, if any, and an error code indicating the HTTP status code returned by the server. If `error` is nil then `userInfo` will exist and vice versa.\n\nIn our completionHandler, we will parse through the returned data and save anything useful for later.\n\n```swift\ncompletionHandler: {(userInfo: AnyObject?, error: NSError?) in\n\n    // First, check if an error occurred\n    if error != nil {\n        //handle errors\n    }\n\n    // We would like to save the share links returned by the Referral SaaSquatch server.\n    guard let shareLinks = userInfo?[\"shareLinks\"] as? [String: AnyObject],\n        let shareLink = shareLinks[\"shareLink\"] as? String,\n        let facebookShareLink = shareLinks[\"mobileFacebookShareLink\"] as? String,\n        let twitterShareLink = shareLinks[\"mobileTwitterShareLink\"] as? String, else {\n            return\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### Make the referral\n\nOnce the user is registered and any useful information returned in `userInfo` has been saved away, we will make their referral with Referral SaaSquatch. We'll call `applyReferralCode` with the code our user gave us and their userId, accountId and token. The function validates the referral code. If the code is successful the reward information will be returned in `userInfo`, or if the code cannot be applied to the account an error will be returned.\n\n```swift\nSaasquatch.applyReferralCode(\"BOBTESTERSON\", forTenant: tenant, toUserID: userId, toAccountID: accountId, withToken: token,\n    completionHandler: {(userInfo: AnyObject?, error: NSError?) in\n\n        // First, make sure there is no error\n        if error != nil {\n            //handle errors\n        }\n\n        // Parse the referral code information returned in userInfo\n        guard let reward = userInfo?[\"reward\"] as? [String: AnyObject],\n        let type = reward[\"type\"] as? String else {\n            return\n        }\n\n        // For a complete list of reward types and fields, please visit http://docs.referralsaasquatch.com/api/methods/#open_apply_code\n        if type == \"PCT_DISCOUNT\" {\n            guard let percent = reward[\"discountPercent\"] as? Int else {\n                return\n            }\n        }\n\n        // Do something with the reward\n    })\n```\n\nDuring your user's registration, you may want to look up a referral code they entered to check it's existance and get information about the associated reward. The call is very similar to `applyReferralCode` and returns the same reward information in `userInfo`. The tenant and referral code are the only required parameters, but if you make too many calls without a token you may get a 401: Unauthorized response. For a complete description of the available fields, visit the [SaaSquatch docs](../../../api/methods/#open_apply_code \"Referral SaaSquatch REST API reference\").\n\n```swift\nSaasquatch.lookupReferralCode(\"BOBTESTERSON\", forTenant: tenant, withToken: token,\n    completionHandler: {(userInfo: AnyObject?, error: NSError?) in\n\n        // Parse the reward as in applyReferralCode(_:forTenant:toUserID:toAccountID:withToken:completionHandler)\n\n    })\n```\n\n\n#### Lookup who referred our new user\n\nThe last thing we would like to do is let our user know they have been referred successfully. Let's lookup the user that referred them so we can let our user know who they can thank. For this, we can use the `userByReferralCode` method like this:\n\n```swift\nSaasquatch.userByReferralCode(\"BOBTESTERSON\", forTenant: tenant, withToken: token,\n    completionHandler: {(userInfo: AnyObject?, error: NSError?) in\n\n        // Always check the error\n        if error != nil {\n            //handle errors\n        }\n\n        // Parse the returned information\n        guard let referrerFirstName = userInfo?[\"firstName\"] as? String,\n            let referrerLastInitial = userInfo?[\"lastInitial\"] as? String,\n            let referrerImageURL = userInfo?[\"imageUrl\"] as? String else {\n                return\n        }\n\n        // Now we can use this information to inform our user of their referral\n    })\n```\n\nGreat! We registered our new user with Referral SaaSquatch and successfully made a referral.\n\n\n#### List Referrals\n\nLet's add one more bit of functionality to our app to demonstrate `listReferralsForTenant`. Bob Testerson referred our new user, Claire Fraser, and we would like to show him a list of everyone he's referred (it's a lot). To do this, we call `listReferralsForTenant`.\n\nThis method looks up all the referrals for us, the tenant. The other required parameter is a token to authenticate the request. The remainder of the parameters are options for filtering this list. In this case, we want to list only the referrals where Bob is the *referrer*. We will pass in Bob's userId and accountId and parse the list returned in `userInfo`. For a description of the options for filtering, see the [SaaSquatch\ndocs](../../../api/methods/#open_list_referrals \"Referral SaaSquatch REST API reference\").\n\n```swift\nSaasquatch.listReferralsForTenant(tenant, withToken: token, forReferringAccountID: bobsAccountId, forReferringUserID: bobsUserId, beforeDateReferralPaid: nil, beforeDateReferralEnded: nil, withReferredModerationStatus: nil, withReferrerModerationStatus: nil, withLimit: nil, withOffset: nil,\n    completionHandler: {(userInfo: AnyObject?, error: NSError?) in\n\n        // Check the error\n        if (error != nil) {\n            //handle errors\n        }\n\n        // Parse the list of referrals\n        guard let referrals: NSArray = userInfo![\"referrals\"] as?

This is a short list to get your familiar with some of the terms and referral lingo. \n\n- __Referrer__\n\n  A person who invites another person to try the product or service.\n\n- __Referred User / Referree__\n\n  A person who was referred by another person.\n\n- __[Touchpoints](/success/touchpoints/)__\n\n  The components of your referral program that your users interact with to participate in or get information about the referral program.\n\n- __Referral Widget__\n\n  The main window that enables your users to share the referral program with their friends and track their individual progress. \n\n- __Share messages__\n\n  Predefined social or messaging copy that explain the offer and have a clear CTA. Used by your customers to invite friends and family. \n\n- __Notification emails__\n\n  Emails the referrer receives to notify them about their referral progress. \n\n- __Rewards__\n\n  The reward you are handing out to your users for making a successful referral. I.E. 10% discount on their next bill,  $25 store credit, loyalty points, or a t-shirt. \n\n- __[Conversion](/success/core-topics/#Conversion)__\n\n  The last step a referred user needs to complete in order for the referral to be considered successful and generate a reward for the referrer. This can vary from account sign up, lead submission, paid subscription started, to a checkout depending on the business. \n\nOur [Core Topics](/success/core-topics/) article provides more in depth information on these topics. \n\n### Components of a referral program\nThe referral program is build up from a range of different components that interact with both your existing and newly brought on users. Components like the referral widget or the reward fulfillment tie into your website and payment system. Let’s start with the main interface your customers will interact with.\n\n#### Referral Widget\nThe Referral Widget is easily loaded by providing SaaSquatch with a few details about your customers. SaaSquatch will return a fully rendered responsive referral widget that you can load inside your product or service. \n\n<div>\n<a class=\"docs-lightbox\" href=\"//images.contentful.com/s68ib1kj8k5n/1lORITdPfyMQWkqY2gosE4/1117d2d91ab9d230300828318f25e8e4/referral_widget_live.png\" data-lightbox=\"example-set\">\n  ![referral widget live](//images.contentful.com/s68ib1kj8k5n/1lORITdPfyMQWkqY2gosE4/1117d2d91ab9d230300828318f25e8e4/referral_widget_live.png)\n  <div><i class=\"fa fa-eye\"></i> Preview</div>\n</a>\n</div>\n\nThis touchpoint engages your current customers and explains the offer. Make sure to stay on point and communicate clearly with your users how the referral program works, and what they need to do to earn their reward. The referral widget’s CTA is for your users to start sharing with their friends. \n\nMore information about the referral widget, and how users interact with your referral program can be found in our [touchpoints](/success/touchpoints/) article.\n\n#### Sharing Options \nInside the Referral Widget your users can share the referral offer on a variety of channels. By default E-mail, Twitter and Facebook share buttons are visible to your users. You can work together with your Customer Success team to add or remove share options and pick the best options that match your customer base. \n\n<div>\n<a class=\"docs-lightbox\" href=\"//images.contentful.com/s68ib1kj8k5n/4Oed6VvJ9egQcaGESi6o88/262315336d01d54968fb3f7964da0599/facebook_share_messaging_options.png\" data-lightbox=\"example-set\">\n![facebook share messaging options](//images.contentful.com/s68ib1kj8k5n/4Oed6VvJ9egQcaGESi6o88/262315336d01d54968fb3f7964da0599/facebook_share_messaging_options.png) <div><i class=\"fa fa-eye\"></i> Preview</div> <a class=\"docs-lightbox\" href=\"//images.contentful.com/s68ib1kj8k5n/4oRHdLbUakEoQuOkgMy06O/3fcae2a2f6d6c873e89818ca7a3c23a7/twitter_share_messaging_options.png\" data-lightbox=\"example-set\">![twitter share messaging options](//images.contentful.com/s68ib1kj8k5n/4oRHdLbUakEoQuOkgMy06O/3fcae2a2f6d6c873e89818ca7a3c23a7/twitter_share_messaging_options.png)\n<div><i class=\"fa fa-eye\"></i> Preview</div>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n\nMore info and examples are available in the [Share Options](success/share-options/) article. \n\n#### Unique Sharelink & referral codes\nOne of the main goals of the sharing messages is to have a referrer share their unique sharelink and / or referral code to their friends, the potential referred customers. These are the primary ways of establishing referral connections between two users, a process we call [Attribution](/success/core-topics/#Attribution). \n\n<div>\n<a class=\"docs-lightbox\" href=\"//images.contentful.com/s68ib1kj8k5n/3YnsN3TmMM0KwEUySKMC28/5350d208f41b8ec9504ab21d3d9d2adb/referral_widget_link_code.png\" data-lightbox=\"example-set\">\n![referral widget link code](//images.contentful.com/s68ib1kj8k5n/3YnsN3TmMM0KwEUySKMC28/5350d208f41b8ec9504ab21d3d9d2adb/referral_widget_link_code.png)\n<div><i class=\"fa fa-eye\"></i> Preview</div>\n</a>\n</div>\n\nThe Unique Sharelink performs two tasks when it is clicked by a referred visitor.  First it drops a tracking cookie in the user’s browser, this allows us to know who sent this potential customer, and automatically create a referral connection. Secondly it redirects this new traffic to your website. You can decide whether you want to funnel them through your normal sign up or purchase flow, or set up a designated Landing page. \n\nReferral Codes are a way to establish a referral connection without tracking cookies. The referred user receives the code from their friend and is required to fill in the referral code on a form during checkout or registration. Alternatively, this can be autofilled as a coupon or into  another relevant field.  More info on Unique Sharelinks & Referral Codes can be found in our [Share Options](/success/share-options/#Code) article. \n\n#### Landing page \nThis is the first impression of your product that potential new customers will see, so make it count! A designated Landing page is a great place to recognize that the user was referred, explain the offer they will receive and why they should sign up. \n\n<div>\n<a class=\"docs-lightbox\" href=\"//images.contentful.com/s68ib1kj8k5n/5BGt1hHuYoK4qykU0Kwaiy/43e952b9fd591cc607b21e0b3b372aba/referral_landing_page_example.png\" data-lightbox=\"example-set\">\n![referral landing page example](//images.contentful.com/s68ib1kj8k5n/5BGt1hHuYoK4qykU0Kwaiy/43e952b9fd591cc607b21e0b3b372aba/referral_landing_page_example.png)\n<div><i class=\"fa fa-eye\"></i> Preview</div>\n</a>\n</div>\n\n#### Sign up flow\nIf you offer some sort of discount or credit to the referred user, you should enhance your sign up flow to reflect this change. Whether you flag the newly created account for a pending account credit, add a generic discount code to their order, or give them additional free time, the reward fulfillment comes into play.  \n\nOnce the referred user signed up for your service of product, you can identify them to SaaSquatch through the Referral Widget and entice them to start making their own referrals. \n\n#### Billing & Reward fulfillment \nDepending on the reward that you have chosen for your referral program, the reward fulfillment can range from your customers automatically receiving a gift card through email, their next bill being lowered automatically through our Payment Provider integrations, or them receiving an account credit for a future purchase. \n\nReferral SaaSquatch can [help you choose the right reward](http://www.referralsaasquatch.com/choosing-rewards-for-your-referral-program/) for your Referral Program and provide you with all the caveats and details on the reward fulfillment steps.\n#### Notification emails\nWhenever a referred user signs up for your service, Referral SaaSquatch can automatically send the referrer an update on the progress of their referral. This email is a great way to give positive feedback to your users and inform them of any earned rewards. We also include the sharing options from the Referral Widget in these emails so the user can easily refer more friends. \n\n<div>\n<a class=\"docs-lightbox\" href=\"//images.contentful.com/s68ib1kj8k5n/3kY9y28NlSuGeMWMUCG8yu/0f6bf73f89147f629986a4502f521ba3/parkwhiz_referral_complete_email.png\" data-lightbox=\"example-set\">\n  ![parkwhiz referral complete email](//images.contentful.com/s68ib1kj8k5n/3kY9y28NlSuGeMWMUCG8yu/0f6bf73f89147f629986a4502f521ba3/parkwhiz_referral_complete_email.png)\n  <div><i class=\"fa fa-eye\"></i> Preview</div>\n</a>\n</div>\n\nMore information on the referral program email notifications is available in our [Touchpoints](/success/touchpoints/) article or in our [technical documentation](/topics/email/). \n\n### Managing a referral program\nSo you have a referral program that’s up and running, great! Now let’s go over what you should keep an eye on. \n\n#### Take a look at your analytics\nThe SaaSquatch portal’s [Analytics](/features/analytics/) page gives you vital information about your Referral Program’s performance. \n\n<div>\n<a class=\"docs-lightbox\" href=\"//images.contentful.com/s68ib1kj8k5n/4VtCAG8wA0M8IiQuSqgkQI/e917640076cc8f95d49d8308d3dfe429/analtytics_preview.png\" data-lightbox=\"example-set\">\n  ![analtytics preview](//images.contentful.com/s68ib1kj8k5n/4VtCAG8wA0M8IiQuSqgkQI/e917640076cc8f95d49d8308d3dfe429/analtytics_preview.png)\n  <div><i class=\"fa fa-eye\"></i> Preview</div>\n</a>\n</div>\n\n#### Key Analytics metrics to look at:\nReferred Visitors: The number of time your referral program sharelinks have been clicked.\nReferred Users: The number of users who have signed up for your service as a result of a referral\nPaid Conversions: The number of new paying customers successfully referred to your service.\nMore information on what analytics metrics are available, definitions of each of the terms, and how to make the most of the analytics portal can be found in our [analytics docs](/features/analytics/).\n\n#### Take a look at potential fraud cases \nThe SaaSquatch Portal comes with a security system that helps you keep the bad apples out and reward real referrals. More info on our [Security features is available in our documentation](/fraud-and-security/). \n### Referral Program best practices \nWhether you launched your Referral Program months ago or are looking to kick off soon, these best practices and tips will help you get the best results. \n\n#### Make sure the program is visible \nWith the Referral SaaSquatch platform you can surface the Referral Widget on different places inside your product which helps drive more engagement from your users. For example you can surface the program after your customer makes a purchase, fills out a feedback form or upgrades to a bigger plan. \n\nYou can also incorporate the program information, or even the user’s unique sharelinks in transactional emails and other touch points inside your product. \n#### Pick a reward that your customers actually want\nThe core part of your Referral Program is the reward you hand out to your users. Pick a double sided reward that both sides would love to get. \n\nIf you are running a B2B product or service where your users don’t pay the invoice themselves, consider a Gift Card program. Instead of getting a discount the user doesn’t feel or experience themselves, give them the opportunity to buy that new gadget or book to get a positive brand experience and keep the referrals flowing. \n#### Hand out rewards as soon as possible\nWe all like to get our reward as soon as we earned it. Although from a business perspective it might make sense to hold off on rewarding the referrer until the referred user pays their second invoice, the long delay in reward fulfillment may cause less participation in your program. The more strongly, and quickly, and action is rewarded the more likely it is to be repeated. \n#### Keep things simple\nHaving a hard time explaining the offer to your customers? Try keeping the offer simple so it’s easy to communicate to your customers. The rule of thumb is; If you can’t explain the offer to your customers in a single sentence, then simplify the offer.\n\nLooking for more ways to optimize your referral program? \nDownload our [E-Commerce Referral Marketing Guide](http://get.referralsaasquatch.com/ecommerce-referral-marketing-ebook-resources/)\n### Further resources & reading material\nNow that you have a healthy referral program acquiring new customers for you, here are some additional resources to help you get the most out of your referral marketing strategy.\n- [SaaS Case Study with Typeform](http://get.referralsaasquatch.com/case-study-typeform-website/)\n- [Referral Marketing Best Practices Guide](http://get.referralsaasquatch.com/resources-referral-program-best-practice/)\n- [Referral Program User Experience Guide](http://get.referralsaasquatch.com/resources-user-experience-ebook/)\n"

These actions typically involve looking up information about a referred user or who referred them.\n\nSome examples include:\n - [Lookup a referral code](/api/methods/#open_validate_code) after app install to display a dialog about who referred them\n - [Register a new user](/api/methods/#open_create_user) in the referral program\n - [Lookup share links](/api/methods/#open_get_user) to display a custom sharing dialog\n - [Lookup referrals](/api/methods/#open_list_referrals) to display a list of referred friends\n\n> #### Enable Open Endpoints\n>\n> Open Endpoints are disabled by default for security and functionality reasons. \n> As a core component of our [Mobile SDK](/mobile/), Open Endpoints are provided as an optional addon to Pro and Enterprise plans. \n> If the Mobile SDK, and Open Endpoints, are features you would like to make use of, please contact our [sales team](mailto:sales@referralsaasquatch.com) to discuss adding them to your subsciption.\n\n### Authentication Options\nThe Open Enpoints provide flexible authentication options: \n- **Authenticated** - For Open Endpoint calls that reqire authentication there are two options:\n  - **JWT** - JWTs can be used for requests that require authentication. \n  - **API Key** - Your tenant's API key can also be used for requests that require authentication. \n- **Unauthenticated** - Some Open Endpoints do not require any form of authentication.\n\n#### Rate Limit\nFor security purposes there are limits on the number of requests that can be made using unauthenticated, and JWT authenticated, requests on your live tenant. Requests made using your API key, and any request made on your Test tenant, provide unlimited requests.\n\nThis functionallity is desiged such that only your backend system (as part of server-server communcation authenticated with your API key) can make a large number of requests. Individual client devices are only able to make a limited number of requests.\n\nIf the Open Endpoints are used correctly (mainly that server-server authentication is being done with your API key) these limitations should never be encountered.\n\nThe following table summarizes the Open Endpoint methods that are available for use, their required authentication, and the rate limits that apply when using unauthenitcated calls or those authenticated with JWTs:\n\n<table class=\"table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n    <th>\n        Open Endpoint method\n    </th>\n    <th>\n        Authentication required\n    </th>\n    <th>\n        Rate limits\n    </th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n    <td class=\"docs-monospace\">[Create a user](/api/methods#open_create_user)</td>\n    <td>\n        Requires Write Token or API key\n    </td>\n    <td>\n        Limited to 50 per day per IP\n    </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n    <td class=\"docs-monospace\">[Lookup a user](/api/methods#open_get_user)</td>\n    <td>\n        Requires Read Token or API key\n    </td>\n    <td>\n        Limited to 100 per hour per IP\n    </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n    <td class=\"docs-monospace\">[Lookup a user by referral code](/api/methods#open_get_user_by_code)</td>\n    <td>\n        No authentication required.\n    </td>\n    <td>\n        Limited to 100 per hour per IP\n    </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n    <td class=\"docs-monospace\">[Lookup a referral code](/api/methods#open_validate_code)</td>\n    <td>\n        No authentication required.\n    </td>\n    <td>\n        Limited to 100 per hour per IP\n    </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n    <td class=\"docs-monospace\">[Apply a referral code](/api/methods#open_apply_code)</td>\n    <td>\n        Requires Write Token or API key.\n    </td>\n    <td>\n        Limited to 100 per hour per IP\n    </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n    <td class=\"docs-monospace\">[List referrals](/api/methods#open_list_referrals)</td>\n    <td>\n        Requires Read Token or API key.\n    </td>\n    <td>\n        Limited to 100 per hour per IP\n    </td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n### Authentication with JWT\nAuthentication with JWTs should be used in client-server use cases.\n\nThe Referral SaaSquatch API accepts two types of JWTs: read tokens, and write tokens. The read tokens are used for calls that involve looking up data while write tokens are used when adding or editing information. The format of the payloads required for read and write tokens are outlined below.\n\n#### Read Token Payload\n\nThe payload of a read token is based on the `user id` and `account id`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"user\": {\n    \"id\": \"adfgafdg\",\n    \"accountId\": \"adfklajdnrerereACdsedf\"\n  },\n  \"exp\": 1462327764 //optional date in seconds since the epoch\n}\n```\n\n#### Write Token Payload\n\nThe payload of a write token contains the complete user object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"user\": {\n    \"id\": \"adfgafdg\",\n    \"accountId\": \"adfklajdnrerereACdsedf\",\n    \"email\": \"bob@example.com\",\n    \"firstName\": \"Bob\",\n    \"lastName\": \"Testerson\", //optional\n    \"locale\": \"en_US\", //optional\n    \"referralCode\": \"BOBTESTERSON\", //optional\n    \"imageUrl\": \"\" //optional\n  },\n  \"exp\": 1462327764 //optional date in seconds since the epoch\n}\n```\n\n#### Building the JWT\nThe JWTs used with Open endpoint are generated using the same method as those used for [Signed Requests](/squatchjs/signed-requests/#Example-Building-the-JWT) for our [squatch.js](/squatchjs/) library. \n\nMake sure you that you are using the correct format of the payload for your specific Open Endpoint call as outlined above.\n\n#### Example Call with JWT\nThe JWT is provided in the header of the call as `X-SaaSquatch-User-Token`.\n\ncURL uses the `-H` flag to pass an extra header. You may specify any number of extra headers.\n\n```\ncurl https://app.referralsaasquatch.com/api/v1/{TENANT_ALIAS}/open/account/{ACCOUNT_ID}/user/{USER_ID} \\\n-H \"X-SaaSquatch-User-Token: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwXzIzOTQ4MzQ5MzQifQ.8P42BrwqkZhchHJw_qYUNBc_iZb6TspPOkbtc5WvP_0\"\n```\n\n### Authentication with API Key\nAuthenticaion with your API key should be done when conducting server-server communication.\n\nAuthenticating Open Endpoint calls with an API key is done in the same way as with our standard API calls, details for which can be found in [API Authentication](/api/authentication/).\n\n---"

            },
            "content": {
                "en-US": "Some examples of fraud are:\n\n - **Self-referral**: existing users creating fake referrals to take advantage of referral prizes\n - **Exploitation**: anonymous internet users creating referrals for personal financial gain\n - **Account Cycling**: existing users signing up for and cancelling subsequent accounts\n - **Broadcasting**: Posting referral links on coupon sites or other locations your company does not approve of\n\nThere are three parts to a complete fraud management strategy:\n\n - **Prevention**: the best strategy for fraud management is in the structure of your referral program and identity systems to make fraud financially and logically infeasible.\n - **Detection**: in some cases not all types of fraud can be prevented, leaving additional cases to be detected through automated algorithms and human oversight.\n - **Response**: every business has their own practices on how best to respond to fraud cases, like removing rewards, suspending accounts or even seeking legal recompense.\n\n\n### Fraud Prevention\n\nThe best strategy for fraud management is to prevent fraud before it happens. This can usually be accomplished by choosing the right structure for the referral incentives and the goalpost required to earn a referral credit:\n\n - **Conversion goalposts should be meaningful** to customer acquisition. Typical examples include making a purchase or fully experiencing a product such as setting up a website, verifying a phone number or making your first post. This makes exploiting the referral program harder, while still achieving your business goals.\n - **Incentives should be profitable** to the company immediately or shortly after the conversion goal post is passed by the referred user. This reduces the financial risk of any potential fraud, and in some cases can ensure a positive ROI from every possible referral.\n\nReferral SaaSquatch fraud prevention also takes advantage of a company's existing account and identity systems and leverages them to simplify referral program integration and the fraud preventions systems involved.\n\nReferral SaaSquatch comes with several built-in fraud prevention features:\n\n - **Existing User Detection**: Referral SaaSquatch blocks current paying customers from being referred. This protects against paying users referring themselves or paying users finding a referral link in the wild (i.e. social media or coupon sites) and using it to get a false discount. \n\n - **Two-step Referral Tracking**: Referral SaaSquatch tracks a referral for new users is separated into the two steps of Attribution and Conversion. This lets your referral program be structured so that referral rewards are only triggered for *conversion* goalpost events like purchases even though referrals are fully tracked for free accounts, un-verified accounts or partial carts. \n\n - **Consolidated identity**: Referral SaaSquatch is designed to easily connect with your user database and other identity systems. Users in SaaSquatch are tracked by account and user identities, which means that your existing systems for account de-duplication, email address verification, credit card authorization, social log-in, and account lockdown are automatically tied into your referral program.\n\n - **Explicit Double-sided Incentive Management**: Referral SaaSquatch manages all rewards associated with a referral program; both the rewards earned from making referrals as well as the rewards given to new users in a double-sided incentive program. Referral SaaSquatch also ties these rewards tightly to your users identities. This lets companies have complete control over what rewards users have access to, revoke rewards, track payout and avoid the potential headaches of leaked global-use coupon codes or secret landing pages.\n\nOther fraud prevention measures that involve other systems:\n\n- **The Threat of Cancellation**: Existing users that are looking to game the referral system can often be deterred by the threat of losing access to their account. This is particularly effective for SaaS, games, or marketplace companies because users often have vested value in keeping their accounts active, and fear losing access to a service they regularly use. \n\n\n**Example 1: Bad Incentive, Shallow Goalpost, No Implicit Prevention**: For example, imagine a referral program that gives people $100 in cash for each email address that they provide to an anonymous web form. It is easy to exploit this type program by providing fake email addresses, and anonymous users making referrals. While it would still be possible to create systems for fraud detection and response within Referral SaaSquatch, it would be a routine exercise to get around those systems with access to fake email addresses and proxy servers. Even if someone was caught repeatedly abusing the system, they would have already received their cash payout and the company would have no viable tracking means to pursue response from potentially anonymous individuals.\n\n**Example 2: Good Incentive, Rewards for payment, Implicit Prevention Constraints**: The referral program structure gives people a credit towards a future purchase when a friend makes a purchase. The credit can only be applied against future purchases, preventing people from exploiting the system for cash benefit. The credit is associated with an account, so if someone is caught, the credit could be revoked, the account canceled. The friends are required to make a purchase, creating a paper trail of purchase information (such as credit card) that can be used to de-duplicate accounts, and for fraud detection and response.\n\n\n### Fraud Detection\n\nThe best strategy for fraud management is preventing fraud before it happens, but a company may not have natural systems to prevent fraud, like verifying emails or de-duplicating accounts. In these cases, Referral SaaSquatch provides a way to detect and address fraud.\n\n**Example of detection**: A company's account system does not prevent an email address from being used for more than one account, creating a potential fraud hole since people could refer themselves using their own email address. Referral SaaSquatch helps fill that hole by detecting when two users with the same email address sign up.\n\n**Referral Moderation**\n\nReferral SaaSquatch provides a referral moderation functionality that works much like a blog comment moderation system. You may elect to:\n\n - Approve all referrals until revoked\n - Pend all referrals until approved\n - Approve one side of a referral and pend the other (i.e. approve newly referred users’ prizes while pending referrer’s prizes)\n\nIf you elect to use the referral moderation functionality you will be notified every 24 hours of all referrals requiring review. \n\n### Fraud Response\n\nThe best strategy for fraud management is preventing fraud before it happens, but sometimes you may need to respond to fraud cases regardless either on a one-off basis, or as a general strategy.\n\n**Investigation**\n\nThe first step of responding to a potential fraud case is investigation. Not all cases are worth a formal action. In some cases, for example, multiple people may genuinely share the same name, and the potential case can be ignored.\n\nIn the Referral SaaSquatch security view you can easily see all approved and pending referrals. Each referral shows you dates of the referral and the names of the referrer and referred users. If you see similar names all in a short period, then it’s likely that you have a case of self-referral fraud.\n\nIf the names do not match but you are still suspicious of a referral, perhaps one user has made a large number of referrals in rapid succession, you are able to investigate the referral further and review:\n\n- The IP address of the referrer and referred user\n- The email address of the referrer and referred user\n- The site the referred user clicked the referral link from\n\nAlternatively, if you are suspicious of a specific user you can view their referral history from their profile, which will show you the name and email address of each person they referred. You can then further investigate each referral to verify IP address and referring site. \n\n**Action**\n\nReferral SaaSquatch lets you both **moderate referrals** as they come in, as well as **revoke historical credit** that has not yet been used.\n\n - **Referral Moderation**: Referral SaaSquatch has the ability to mark referral rewards as `PENDING` while one of your agents performs a review. The agent can choose to either Approve or Deny the referral. When a referral is denied, rewards for both sides are either cancelled or never created. If a referral is approved during moderation, it can later be denied. Any rewards that have not been consumed will be cancelled.\n\n - **Cancel Historical Credit**: Referral SaaSquatch allows referral credits to be revoked at any time, regardless of whether they were auto-approved, manually approved, or denied. Any referral can be approved or denied as many times as needed for your business case. There is no timeline by when rewards can be cancelled, but some reward types by their very nature are uncancellable, like for example a coupon that has already been redeemed.\n\nFraud response strategies may also involve other external systems, like your account, ecommerce or CRM systems. Other types of fraud action may not explicitly rely on using Referral SaaSquatch.\n\n - **Account Cancellation**: If someone has been found to be repeatedly abusing the referral system, a logical avenue of recourse would be to cancel their account and blacklist them. In most cases the threat of this is sufficient to stop the activity in question.\n\n\n### Fraud Services\n\nFraud management is not one size fits all. Referral SaaSquatch provides a number of professional services to help design, manage and maintain your referral program and the fraud, gaming and fake referral considerations therein.\n\n - **Fraud Management Strategy Consultation Services**: Referral SaaSquatch has implemented fraud management solutions across industries such eCommerce, SaaS, mobile and POS situations for private and publicly traded companies, startups and fortune 500 companies alike. Companies that subscribe to our Pro and Enterprise plans are eligible for limited complimentary consultation as part of the onboarding package.

Information on each of these core components, how they interact, and the settings for referral moderation that can be adjusted, are provided below.\n## Referral Moderation Flow\nThe Referral SaaSquatch referral moderation process can be broken down into three core components; [Default Status](#Default-Status), [Fraud Criteria](#Fraud-Criteria), and [Fraud Criteria Handling](#Fraud-Criteria-Handling).\n\nThe included flowchart illustrates how an incoming referral will move through the three core components of the referral moderation process, and how different settings will affect the [outcome](#Referral-Moderation-Outcome) of this process for the referral. \n\n<div>\n<a class=\"docs-lightbox\" href=\"//images.contentful.com/s68ib1kj8k5n/7CGrz5tJzqwQ6YEUiekGGo/5c33ddbdacbea3839d99361df79a44bd/Fraud_V2_Flow_-_Page_1__3_.png\" data-lightbox=\"example-set\">\n![Fraud V2 Flow - Page 1 (3)](//images.contentful.com/s68ib1kj8k5n/7CGrz5tJzqwQ6YEUiekGGo/5c33ddbdacbea3839d99361df79a44bd/Fraud_V2_Flow_-_Page_1__3_.png)\n<div><i class=\"fa fa-eye\"></i> Preview</div>\n</a>\n</div>\n\n### Moderation Status\nA core concept in our referral moderation process is the moderation status of the referral. There are three possible values for the moderation status of a referral; Approved, Pending, Denied. This status represents the intended end-action to be applied on the referral by our Security Management System. Throughout the moderation process (explained below) the moderation status can be changed by various components of the Security Management System.\n\n### Default Status \nSetting the default status of the incoming referral is the first stage of the referral moderation flow. These settings apply an initial moderation status to all incoming referrals.\n\n<div>\n<a class=\"docs-lightbox\" href=\"//images.contentful.com/s68ib1kj8k5n/4jBloj8RTOgW2wwwEgeuoS/9a321f21e4a424cf21c029c0d970b924/Advanced_Security_Options.png\" data-lightbox=\"example-set\">\n![Advanced Security Options](//images.contentful.com/s68ib1kj8k5n/4jBloj8RTOgW2wwwEgeuoS/9a321f21e4a424cf21c029c0d970b924/Advanced_Security_Options.png)\n<div><i class=\"fa fa-eye\"></i> Preview</div>\n</a>\n</div>\n\n- Approved - This will leave the status of all incoming referrals as Approved.\n- Pending - Selecting Pending for the default status provides more granular setting options for incoming referrals based on what type of program you are running: \n  - Selecting this option on a Payment Provider program will set the moderation status of an incoming referrals to Pending.\n  - On an API-only program there are options to set the default status for the referrer and referred user rewards independently. It is recommended that if you plan to select Pending as the default status, that you do so only for the referrer while leaving the default status for referred user rewards as Approved. Please see our [note](#Fraud-Analysis-Outcome) in the Referral Moderation Outcome section which explains how these settings will affect the referral.\n\n### Fraud Criteria\nAll incoming referrals, regardless of their default status, will be analyzed against a list of criteria to determine whether they should be considered potentially fraudulent. These criteria currently include Name, Email, IP Address, and Rate. \n\n<div>\n<a class=\"docs-lightbox\" href=\"//images.contentful.com/s68ib1kj8k5n/3MCHNaZJfOYKGoWgQWQYOk/2d1914373414eac288849fa8df6f7857/Criteria_Security_Options.png\" data-lightbox=\"example-set\">\n![Criteria Security Options](//images.contentful.com/s68ib1kj8k5n/3MCHNaZJfOYKGoWgQWQYOk/2d1914373414eac288849fa8df6f7857/Criteria_Security_Options.png)\n<div><i class=\"fa fa-eye\"></i> Preview</div>\n</a>\n</div>\n\nEach of the Fraud Criteria can be individually turned off in the Security Options. Criteria that are turned off will not be checked as part of the referral moderation process.\n#### Name\nThe name of the referrer and the referred user will be compared for similarities. This step checks whether the referrer and referred user share a First and Last name, and if the First and Last names have been reversed (John Doe vs. Doe John). If the two names meet either of these criteria the referral will be flagged. \n#### Email \nThe email address of the referrer and referred user will be compared for similarities using two criteria. The email addresses will be compared to see if both share a common username but different domain name (e.g. johndoe@example.com vs johndoe@website.com). The email addresses will also be compared when email variations are omitted (e.g. johndoe@example.com vs johndoe+variant@example.com). If the two email addresses meet either of these two criteria the referral will be flagged.\n#### IP Address\nThe First Seen and Last Seen IP address value for the referrer and referred user will be compared (this parameter is also available using the [User Lookup](/api/methods/#get_user) API call). If the two users share the same  IP address info then the referral will be flagged.\n#### Rate\nThis option will check the frequency of referral signups made by the referrer. This is given as referrals/time period. The default rate limit for referral signups is 3 referrals per half hour. This means the rate limit will be triggered on the 4th referral signup in a 30 minute period. When the rate limit is reached all 4 of the referrals that were counted towards that limit will also be flagged. \nThe limit can be changed both in volume and frequency (e.g. 3/30min vs. 5/1hour) to meet your program's requirements. Please contact our [support team](mailto:support@referralsaasquatch.com) to make this change.\n\n**Note:** If rewards for the first three flagged referrals have already been redeemed, this cannot be undone. \n### Fraud Criteria Handling\nThe settings for Fraud Criteria Handling determine what action will be performed on a referral based on whether the referral was flagged as potentially being fraudulent. Possible action taken here is limited to downgrades to the existing moderation status (from Approved to Pending, and Pending to Denied). \n\n<div>\n<a class=\"docs-lightbox\" href=\"//images.contentful.com/s68ib1kj8k5n/x3Ghzxk4RayOo2aKmQkci/9bb5bd57f896df4d19b64d4742fcb9c5/General_Security_Options.png\" data-lightbox=\"example-set\">\n![General Security Options](//images.contentful.com/s68ib1kj8k5n/x3Ghzxk4RayOo2aKmQkci/9bb5bd57f896df4d19b64d4742fcb9c5/General_Security_Options.png)\n<div><i class=\"fa fa-eye\"></i> Preview</div>\n</a>\n</div>\n\nThe settings options for Fraud Criteria Handling include:\n\n- Set to Pending - A referral that has been flagged will have its status automatically set as pending. This allows for manual moderation of the pending referrals in the Security section of the portal. Here you can choose to approve or deny the referral based on the information provided about what triggered the referral to be flagged. This is the recommended setting for Fraud Criteria Handling.\n\n- Set to Deny - A referral that is suspected of being fraudulent will be automatically denied. Referrals that have been denied are listed as such in the Referral History. The denial of this referral can be reversed at a later point by selecting the referral from the Referral History and changing the status from Denied to Approved. \n\n- Ignore - This setting will take no action based on fraud criteria, and all referrals will be left with the Default Status. (This is the default setting for all programs)\n\n### Referral Moderation Outcome\nAfter passing through all three core components of the moderation process each referral is moved into one of three \"pools\" based on its moderation status. \n\n<div>\n<a class=\"docs-lightbox\" href=\"//images.contentful.com/s68ib1kj8k5n/5vcERQz2TeKisE4ooMaiMu/ec2f14655887c2f3353f0dc68a6316da/Program_Security.png\" data-lightbox=\"example-set\">\n![Program Security](//images.contentful.com/s68ib1kj8k5n/5vcERQz2TeKisE4ooMaiMu/ec2f14655887c2f3353f0dc68a6316da/Program_Security.png)\n<div><i class=\"fa fa-eye\"></i> Preview</div>\n</a>\n</div>\n\nReferrals that made it to the end of the process with an approved moderation status will pass out of the Security Management System and have their respective rewards created.\n\nReferrals that had their status changed to Pending during the moderation process will be placed under Pending Referrals in the Program Security page. A decision can then be made about whether to approve or deny the referral based on the provided Fraud Criteria information.\n\nReferrals that have had their status changed to Denied during the moderation process will be listed in the Referral History section of the Program Security page. If you would like to Approve these referrals at a later date simply select the referral and change the status toggle from Denied to Approved.\n\n#### Note for API Programs:\nIf you are using an API program and have set Default Status differently for referrers and referred users the outcome of the referral moderation process will be slightly different. \n\nIf the referral is not flagged for being potentially fraudulent, or your Fraud Criteria Handling settings are configured to \"Take no action\" on flagged referrals, then the referral will be left (as it was set in the default status step) with the referral’s referred user moderation status as Approved, the referral’s referrer moderation status as Pending, and the referral moderation status as Pending. \n\nIf the referral is flagged for being potentially fraudulent, and your Fraud Criteria Handling setting are configured to set flagged referrals as pending, then the referral as a whole will be set to Pending.\n\nIf the referral is flagged for being potentially fraudulent, and your Fraud Criteria Handling setting are configured to set flagged referrals as Denied, then the referral as a whole will be set to Denied.\n\n#### Note for Payment Provider Programs:\nThe reward for the referred user is not handled by our system as it is fulfilled as part of their checkout experience inside your product or website which our system does not control. As such, while the moderation status of the referral might indicate that the referral has been set to Pending or Denied, the status of the referred user reward will always stay as Approved. For more information on the mechanics of Payment Provider Programs please take a look at our [Stripe](/developer/stripe/) and [Recurly](/developer/recurly/) Guides.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions \n### Does this change my existing program?\nNo, existing programs will have their Security Management settings default to take no action. Referrals will still be flagged as part of the referral moderation process so that you can still see any potentially fraudulent activity. These criteria, which are visible when viewing an individual referral, can help you better understand the impact of turning on the Security Management system for your program. \n\nIf you have any questions about the advantages that turning on the Security Management System will have for your program, as well as any concerns about conflicts it might bring up, please feel free to contact our [support team](mailto:support@referralsaasquatch.com).\n### What happens if a referral gets accidentally flagged as fraudulent?\nThis referral will be held for moderation and you can still approve these referrals. \n\nThe program owner will be notified about pending referrals so any referrals that do get flagged can be looked into.\n### How can I add my own Security Management System?\nThe Referral SaaSquatch platform enables you to extend our referral moderation process through your own referral moderation logic if you so choose. \n\nPlease contact our [support team](mailto:support@referralsaasquatch.com) to find out more about how to go about your referral program even more powerful.\n"

JWTs are small enough to be used in a GET or POST parameter or an HTTP header and because they are digitally signed the information inside can be trusted. This allows us to use a JWT like a checksum to verify that the squatch.js init parameters are correct, but with the convenience of using a library to generate the JWT.\n\n### How do I generate a JWT?\n\nJWTs can easily be generated using one of the [libraries](https://jwt.io/#libraries-io) available. There are even more libraries in even more languages available on [GitHub](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=json+web+token&type=Repositories&ref=searchresults) in addition to the ones recommended by [JWT.io](https://jwt.io).\n\n**Don't forget!** You have a both a live API key and a test API key.\n\n### Example: Building the JWT\n\nStarting with the JSON object of the parameters passed to the squatch.js init call:\n\n**Note:** Make sure ignore client-only parameters like `mode`, and `locale`\n\n```\n{\n  \"tenant_alias\": \"test_aaaexampleaaa\",\n  \"account_id\": \"a5678\",\n  \"payment_provider_id\": null,\n  \"user_id\": \"u1234\",\n  \"email\": \"joe.tester@example.com\",\n  \"first_name\": \"Joe\",\n  \"last_name\": \"Tester\",\n}```\n\n1.  Assemble the JWT payload based on the above squatch.js init object:\n  \n  ```\n  {\n      \"user\": {\n        \"id\": \"u1234\",\n        \"accountId\": \"a5678\",\n        \"firstName\": \"Joe\",\n        \"lastName\": \"Tester\",\n        \"email\": \"joe.tester@example.com\",\n        \"paymentProviderId\": null\n      }\n  }```\n  \n2.  Use your chosen library to build the JWT with the payload, and sign it with your API key.\n\t<ul class=\"nav nav-tabs\" id=\"jwt-code-samples\">\n\t\t<li><a href=\"#\" data-toggle=\"tab\" data-target=\".calculatejwt-example-cs\">C#</a></li>\n\t\t<li><a href=\"#\" data-toggle=\"tab\" data-target=\".calculatejwt-example-rb\">Ruby</a></li>\n\t\t<li><a href=\"#\" data-toggle=\"tab\" data-target=\".calculatejwt-example-java\">Java</a></li>\n\t\t<li><a href=\"#\" data-toggle=\"tab\" data-target=\".calculatejwt-example-php\">PHP</a></li>\n\t\t<li class=\"active\"><a href=\"#\" data-toggle=\"tab\" data-target=\".calculatejwt-example-py\">Python</a></li>\n\t</ul>\n  \t\n    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n\n\t<div class=\"tab-pane calculatejwt-example-cs\">\n\t<pre><code class=\"lang-cs\">using System.Collections.Generic;\n\tusing System.Text;\n\tusing Jose;\n\n\tnamespace JWTExample\n\t{\n\t\tclass Program\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tpublic static string buildJWT(string secret, string accountId, string userId, string email, string firstName, string lastName, long expiryDate, string referralCode, string userReferralCode, string accountStatus, string userImage)\n\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\tvar userPayload = new Dictionary<string, object>()\n\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t  { \"id\", userId },\n\t\t\t\t  { \"accountId\", accountId },\n\t\t\t\t  { \"firstName\", firstName },\n\t\t\t\t  { \"lastName\", lastName },\n\t\t\t\t  { \"email\", email },\n\t\t\t\t  { \"userReferralCode\", userReferralCode },\n\t\t\t\t  { \"referralCode\", referralCode },\n\t\t\t\t  { \"userImage\", userImage},\n\t\t\t\t  { \"accountStatus\", accountStatus }\n\t\t\t\t};\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tvar payload = new Dictionary<string, object>()\n\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t  { \"user\", userPayload },\n\t\t\t\t  { \"exp\", expiryDate } //optional date in seconds since the epoch\n\t\t\t\t};\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t//the encoding must match the encoding of your secret, UTF8 is just an example\n\t\t\t\tvar byteSecret = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(secret);\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\treturn Jose.JWT.Encode(payload, byteSecret, JwsAlgorithm.HS256);\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t}</code></pre>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div class=\"tab-pane calculatejwt-example-rb\">\n\t<pre><code class=\"lang-rb\">require 'jwt'\n\n\tdef buildJWT(secret, userId, accountId, email, firstName, lastName, referralCode, userReferralCode, accountStatus, userImage, expiryDate)\n\t\tsecret = 'Referral SaaSquatch API key'\n\t\treturn payload = JWT.encode({\n\t\tuser: {\n\t\tid: userId,\n\t\taccountId: accountId,\n\t\tfirstName: firstName,\n\t\tlastName: lastName,\n\t\treferralCode: referralCode,\n\t\tuserReferralCode: userReferralCode,\n\t\taccountStatus: accountStatus,\n\t\tuserImage: userImage\n\t\t},\n\t\texp: expiryDate #optional date in seconds since the epoch\n\t\t}, secret)\n\tend</code></pre>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div class=\"tab-pane calculatejwt-example-java\">\n\t<pre><code class=\"lang-java\">import com.auth0.jwt.Algorithm;\n\timport com.auth0.jwt.JWTSigner;\n\timport com.auth0.jwt.JWTSigner.Options;\n\n\tpublic static String buildJWT(String secret, String accountId, String userId, String email, String firstName, String lastName, Long expiryDate, String referralCode, String userReferralCode, String accountStatus, String userImage) {\n\t\t//build user object\n\t\tMap<String, Object> userMap = new HashMap<String, Object>();\n\t\tuserMap.put(\"id\", userId);\n\t\tuserMap.put(\"accountId\", accountId);\n\t\tuserMap.put(\"firstName\", firstName);\n\t\tuserMap.put(\"lastName\", lastName);\n\t\tuserMap.put(\"email\", email);\n\t\tuserMap.put(\"userReferralCode\", userReferralCode);\n\t\tuserMap.put(\"referralCode\", referralCode);\n\t\tuserMap.put(\"userImage\", userImage);\n\t\tuserMap.put(\"accountStatus\", accountStatus);\n\t\t\n\t\t//create token\n\t\tJWTSigner signer = new JWTSigner(secret);\n\t\tMap<String, Object> claims = new HashMap<String, Object>();\n\t\tclaims.put(\"user\", userMap);\n\t\tif (expiryDate != null) {\n\t\tclaims.put(\"exp\", expiryDate.longValue());

The signed value is a concatenated string assembled from the [squatch.js init](/squatchjs#init) parameter map. As a simple convention, the values are concatenated based on an alphabetical ordering of the parameter names. This will become more clear in an example below. The final piece missing is the HMAC algorithm’s shared secret: your account’s API key.\n\n**Don't forget!** You have a both a live API key and a test API key.\n\n### Example: Generating a Checksum\n\nTo start using secure requests, you simply need to add a checksum. For example, here is a JSON object of the parameters to be signed:\n\n<pre><code class=\"lang-json\">{\n    \"tenant_alias\": \"test_aaaexampleaaa\",\n    \"account_id\": \"a5678\",\n    \"payment_provider_id\": null,\n    \"user_id\": \"u1234\",\n    \"email\": \"joe.tester@example.com\",\n    \"first_name\": \"Joe\",\n    \"last_name\": \"Tester\",\n    \"mode\": \"EMBED\",\n    \"locale\": \"en_US\"\n}</code></pre>\n\n1.  **Ignore client-only parameters** that don't need to be signed. The `mode`, `locale` parameters should be ignored.\n  ```JSON\n  {\n      \"tenant_alias\": \"test_aaaexampleaaa\",\n      \"account_id\": \"a5678\",\n      \"payment_provider_id\": null,\n      \"user_id\": \"u1234\",\n      \"email\": \"joe.tester@example.com\",\n      \"first_name\": \"Joe\",\n      \"last_name\": \"Tester\",\n      //\"mode\": \"EMBED\",\n      //\"locale\": \"en_US\"\n  }```\n\n2.  **Sort your parameters** according to the alphabetical order of their keys. Notice how `account_id` is now first and `user_id` is now last.\n  ```JSON\n  {\n      \"account_id\": \"a5678\", // <-- \"a\" is sorted to first\n      \"email\": \"joe.tester@example.com\",\n      \"first_name\": \"Joe\",\n      \"last_name\": \"Tester\",\n      \"payment_provider_id\": null,\n      \"tenant_alias\": \"test_aaaexampleaaa\",\n      \"user_id\": \"u1234\" // <-- \"u\" is sorted to last\n  }```\n\n3.  **Concatenate the <em>sorted</em> values.** Starting with an empty string, iterate through all the parameters that you sorted and append each parameter's value to the end of a string. Notice how \"a5678\", the value for <code>account_id</code>, is at the start, and \"u1234\", the value for <code>user_id</code>, is at the end. Also, any optional parameters or null parameters can be omitted. In this example <code>payment_provider_id</code> is set to null and isn't included in the concatenated string.\n\n  <pre><span style=\"color:#dd1144;\">a5678</span>joe.tester@example.com<span style=\"color:#dd1144;\">Joe</span>Tester<span style=\"color:#dd1144;\">test_aaaexampleaaa</span>u1234\n^^^ the value for accountId is first</code></pre>\n\n4.  **Sign the string** using your API key to compute a HMAC-SHA2 checksum.

For our other integration types the Signed Requests are turned on as soon as we receive the first Signed Request.\nIf you turned off Signed Requests through the Referral SaaSquatch Portal, you can't turn them back on manually. Signed Requests are automatically turned back on when we receive a Signed Request with your [squatch.js init function](/squatchjs#init).\n\n### How do I turn off Signed Requests?\nWe **highly recommend** using Signed Requests to prevent users from simulating referrals through the javascript. When you turn off Signed Requests, we recommend to turn off auto moderation on the Security page. Instead you can manually review & approve referrals as an additional security layer.\n<img src=\"/assets/images/signed-requests.jpg\" alt=\"turn signed requests on and off\" />\n\nSigned Requests can be turned off through the Referral SaaSquatch Portal. Navigate to the **Install page** and locate the **Secure Mode** header under which the current status of Signed Requests is displayed. By clicking disable, the Signed Requests will no longer be required.\n\n*Note: Signed Requests can only be turned off for API integrations.*\n"

Please make sure you have familiarized yourself with these two documents before moving forward with the installation. \n### Getting Started\nTo get started installing your referral program, make sure you have successfully created a Referral SaaSquatch account and project. When you are creating the project, please make sure you choose your Program Reward as either Dollar Credit or Percent Discount, and your Payment System as Other (via [SaaSquatch API](/api)).\n\nTo make use of either the Percent Discount or Dollar Credit rewards simply follow the version of the reward fulfillment steps of this guide which pertain to your reward type (7a and 8a for Dollar Credit, and 7b and 8b for Percent discount).\n\nIf you have any questions about information in this install guide, or throughout the process of implementing your referral program, don’t hesitate to contact our [support team](mailto:support@referralsaasquatch.com) who will be more than happy to assist you.\n#### Note:\n#### Live and Test Tenant Alias: \nThis Install guide includes references to the tenant alias for your program. Make sure to replace `{{tenant alias}}` with your actual tenant alias found on the install page of your Referral SaaSquatch program portal. Please note that each project includes both a Live and a Test tenant. Please check out our document on [best practices for testing](/testing/).  \n\n#### Signed Requests:\n[Signed Requests](/squatchjs/signed-requests/) are turned on by default with a new project. Places where a checksum is needed in this guide are indicated using `{{CalculatedCheckSum}}`. Information about generating the checksums/JWT’s, and how to turn them off can be found in our docs.\n### Additional Resources:\n- [REST API Reference](/api/) - Provides detailed information about all the methods found in the Referral SaaSquatch REST API\n- [Squatch.js Reference](/squatchjs/) - Provides details about all the functions found in the Referral SaaSquatch squatch.js Javascript Library.\n- Our technical docs also provide additional [Guides](/guides) covering a wide range of use cases which can be helpful for providing further context.\n\n### This Install Guide includes the following steps: \n[1.

Squatch JS Tracking Script [Desktop]\nThe following script will [identify](https://docs.referralsaasquatch.com/success/core-topics/#Identification) a newly registered user to SaaSquatch. We load this script in the nocontent mode for tracking purposes only, which will not show the referral widget. \n\nSquatch JS will automatically look for a referral cookie and make the [referral connection](https://docs.referralsaasquatch.com/success/core-topics/#Attribution). \n\n```\n<-- Insert this javascript right before </body> if possible for improved page load time -->\n\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\nvar _sqh = _sqh || [];\n\n// Push user details for a user who is logged in to your system\n_sqh.push(['init', {\n   tenant_alias: '{{tenant alias}}', // Use the tenant alias.\n   account_id: 'abc_123', // Replace with UID. \n   payment_provider_id: null, // replace with Payment Provider ID if available, otherwise, and for API programs, use null\n   user_id: 'abc_123', // Replace with UID\n   email: 'john@example.com', // Replace with user’s email address \n   first_name: 'John', // Replace with first name if known.\n   last_name: 'Doe', // Replace with last name if known. \n   mode: 'NOCONTENT', // This call is for tracking purposes only, no referral widget \n   account_status: 'TRIAL'. //New signups default to TRIAL, to convert referral change to PAID\n   checksum: '{{CalculatedCheckSum}}' // Checksums are currently turned on. Documentation on usage, and how to turn checksum off, can be found on our Signed Requests page\n\n}]);\n\n// Include squatch.js\n(function(){function l(){var s=document.createElement(\"script\");s.type=\"text/javascript\";s.async=true;s.src=location.protocol+\"//d2rcp9ak152ke1.cloudfront.net/assets/javascripts/squatch.min.js\";var t=document.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0];t.parentNode.insertBefore(s,t)}if(window.attachEvent){window.attachEvent(\"onload\",l)}else{window.addEventListener(\"load\",l,false)}})();\n</script>\n```\n\n### 2. Squatch Mobile Tracking [Mobile]\nUse this SaaSquatch endpoint to [identify](https://docs.referralsaasquatch.com/success/core-topics/#Identification) referred users inside the Mobile app.\n\nThe following is an example to use this endpoint for tracking and conversion purposes:\n\n```\nhttps://app.referralsaasquatch.com/a/{{tenant_alias}}/widgets/squatchwidget\n?paramChecksum={{CalculatedCheckSum}}\n&systemId=abc_123\n&userId=abc_123\n&email=john%40example.com\n&firstName=John\n&lastName=Doe\n&referralCode=JANEDOE\n&accountStatus=TRIAL\n&mode=EMPTY\n```\nThe above example will result in the following url: \n```\nhttps://app.referralsaasquatch.com/a/{{tenat_alias}}/widgets/squatchwidget?paramChecksum={{CalculatedCheckSum}}&systemId=abc_123&userId=abc_123&email=john%40example.com&firstName=John&lastName=Doe&referralCode=JANEDOE&accountStatus=TRIAL&mode=EMPTY\n```\n**Please note:** \n- Make sure to encode special characters. \n- Don’t include paymentProviderId\n- Use systemId instead of account_id \n- The referral code of the referrer this referred user was referred by can be found inside the [Branch integration’s](http://docs.referralsaasquatch.com/mobile/branch-metrics/) JSON format: `\"sq_referralCode\" : \"JANEDOE\"`\n- If this user was not referred, leave the `referralCode` field empty. \n\n### 3. Referral Widget Script [Desktop]\nUse the Squatch JS library to [identify](https://docs.referralsaasquatch.com/success/core-topics/#Identification) users and enable them to share their unique sharelink through email, Facebook or Twitter among their network of friends. \n```\n<-- Insert this div on the page where the widget is suppose to be placed. Typically this is below the header and above the footer. -->\n\n<div id=\"squatchembed\"></div>\n\n<-- Insert this javascript right before </body> if possible for improved page load time -->\n\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\nvar _sqh = _sqh || [];\n\n// Push user details for a user who is logged in to your system\n_sqh.push(['init', {\n   tenant_alias: '{{tenant alias}}', // Use the tenant alias.\n   account_id: 'abc_123', // Replace with UID. \n   payment_provider_id: null, // replace with Payment Provider ID if available, otherwise, and for API programs, use null\n   user_id: 'abc_123', // Replace with UID\n   email: 'john@example.com', // Replace with user’s email address \n   first_name: 'John', // Replace with first name if known.\n   last_name: 'Doe', // Replace with last name if known. \n   mode: 'EMBED', // This forces the widget to load inside the div with the id `squatchembed`.\n   checksum: '{{CalculatedCheckSum}}' // Checksums are currently turned on. Documentation on usage, and how to turn checksum off, can be found on our Signed Requests page.\n\n}]);\n\n// Include squatch.js\n(function(){function l(){var s=document.createElement(\"script\");s.type=\"text/javascript\";s.async=true;s.src=location.protocol+\"//d2rcp9ak152ke1.cloudfront.net/assets/javascripts/squatch.min.js\";var t=document.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0];t.parentNode.insertBefore(s,t)}if(window.attachEvent){window.attachEvent(\"onload\",l)}else{window.addEventListener(\"load\",l,false)}})();\n</script>\n```\n\n### 4. Referral Widget [Mobile]\nUse the [Mobile Widget](http://docs.referralsaasquatch.com/mobile/widget/) to [identify](https://docs.referralsaasquatch.com/success/core-topics/#Identification) users inside the Mobile app and enable them to share their unique sharelink through email, Facebook or Twitter among their network of friends. \n\nThe URL to request the Mobile Widget stores all the parameters. The following is an example to load the Referral Widget for your users. \n```\nhttps://app.referralsaasquatch.com/a/{{tenant alias}}/widgets/mobilewidget\n?userId=abc_123\n&firstName=John\n&lastName=Doe\n&accountId=abc_123\n&paymentProviderId=NULL\n&email=john%40example.com\n&checksum={{CalculatedCheckSum}}\n```\nThe above example will result in the following url: \n```\nhttps://app.referralsaasquatch.com/a/{{tenant alias}}/widgets/mobilewidget?userId=abc_123&firstName=John&lastName=Doe&accountId=abc_123&paymentProviderId=NULL&email=john%40example.com&checksum={{CalculatedCheckSum}}\n```\n**Note:** make sure to encode special characters.\n\n### 5. Conversion Script [Desktop]\n#### Conversion using JavaScript\nWhen a referred user successfully completes their purchase, use the following script to [identify](http://docs.referralsaasquatch.com/topics/identification/) this newly registered user to SaaSquatch. We load this script in the nocontent mode for tracking purposes only, which will not show the referral widget. \n\nSquatch JS will automatically look for a referral cookie and make the [referral connection](https://docs.referralsaasquatch.com/success/core-topics/#Attribution). \n\nAdding the account_status = “PAID” parameter will automatically [convert the referral](https://docs.referralsaasquatch.com/success/core-topics/#Conversion). \n```\n<-- Insert this javascript right before </body> if possible for improved page load time -->\n\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\nvar _sqh = _sqh || [];\n\n// Push user details for a user who is logged in to your system\n_sqh.push(['init', {\n   tenant_alias: '{{tenant alias}}', // Use the tenant alias.\n   account_id: 'abc_123', // Replace with UID. \n   payment_provider_id: null, // replace with Payment Provider ID if available, otherwise, and for API programs, use null\n   user_id: 'abc_123', // Replace with UID\n   email: 'john@example.com', // Replace with user’s email address \n   first_name: 'John', // Replace with first name if known.\n   last_name: 'Doe', // Replace with last name if known. \n   account_status: 'PAID', // Push the PAID account status to convert the referral.\n   mode: 'NOCONTENT', // This call is for tracking purposes only, no referral widget \n   checksum: '{{CalculatedCheckSum}}' // Checksums are currently turned on. Documentation on usage, and how to turn checksum off, can be found on the Signed Requests page.\n\n}]);\n\n// Include squatch.js\n(function(){function l(){var s=document.createElement(\"script\");s.type=\"text/javascript\";s.async=true;s.src=location.protocol+\"//d2rcp9ak152ke1.cloudfront.net/assets/javascripts/squatch.min.js\";var t=document.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0];t.parentNode.insertBefore(s,t)}if(window.attachEvent){window.attachEvent(\"onload\",l)}else{window.addEventListener(\"load\",l,false)}})();\n</script>\n```\nConversion using REST API\nWhen the goal post is hit, the referred user completes their order, SaaSquatch needs to be informed of this [conversion](http://docs.referralsaasquatch.com/topics/conversion/) step so the rewards are created. \n\nThis conversion step can be done by using the [SaaSquatch REST API](http://docs.referralsaasquatch.com/api/) to set the account status to PAID by [updating the Account](http://docs.referralsaasquatch.com/api/methods/#account_sync).\n```\nType: POST\nURL: https://app.referralsaasquatch.com/api/v1/{{tenant alias}}/accountsync \n```\nJSON request\n```\n{\n    \"id\": \"abc_123\",\n    \"subscription\": {\n\"status\": \"PAID\",\n\"billingIntervalType\": \"DAY\",\n\"billingIntervalValue\": 1,\n\"value\": 1\n    }\n}       \n```\nExample response\n```\n{\n    \"id\": \"abc_123\",\n    \"currency\": \"USD\",\n    \"subscription\": {\n        \"status\": \"PAID\",\n        \"value\": 1,\n        \"billingIntervalType\": \"DAY\",\n        \"billingIntervalValue\": 1\n    },\n    \"referral\": {\n        \"code\": \"JANEDOE\"\n    }\n}       \n```\n|\n\nPlease note:\n\nThe following values are required but not used for your program. You can hard code the following values: \n```\n\"billingIntervalType\": \"DAY\",\n\"billingIntervalValue\": 1,\n\"value\": 1\n```\n### 6. Conversion Script [Mobile]\nUse this SaaSquatch endpoint to identify referred users inside the Mobile app and convert the referral after a successful purchase. \n\nThe following is an example to use this endpoint for tracking and conversion purposes:\n```\nhttps://app.referralsaasquatch.com/a/{{tenat_alias}}/widgets/squatchwidget\n?paramChecksum={{CalculatedCheckSum}}\n&systemId=abc_123\n&userId=abc_123\n&email=john%40example.com\n&accountStatus=PAID\n&firstName=John\n&lastName=Doe\n&referralCode=JANEDOE\n&mode=EMPTY\n```\nThe above example will result in the following url: \n```\nhttps://app.referralsaasquatch.com/a/{{tenat_alias}}/widgets/squatchwidget?paramChecksum={{CalculatedCheckSum}}&systemId=abc_123&userId=abc_123&email=john%40example.com&accountStatus=PAID&firstName=John&lastName=Doe&referralCode=JANEDOE&mode=EMPTY\n```\n**Please note:** \n- Make sure to encode special characters. \n- Don’t include `paymentProviderId`\n- Use systemId instead of `account_id`\n- The referral code of the referrer this referred user was referred by can be found inside the [Branch integration’s](http://docs.referralsaasquatch.com/mobile/branch-metrics/) JSON format: `\"sq_referralCode\" : \"JANEDOE\"`\n\n### 7a. Reward Fulfillment - Referred User [Dollar Credit]\nDuring the referred user’s checkout process the referred user should have their reward applied. The following code examples help determine whether or not a user was referred. \n\n#### [Desktop]\nCheck for Referral Code cookie with [Squatch JS autofill](http://docs.referralsaasquatch.com/squatchjs/#autofill). If there is a Referral Code present, this means the user has been referred. \n\nSquatch JS autofill example\nThe following code snippet will check for a referral code with a simple If / Else  statement. \n```\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\nvar _sqh = _sqh || [];\n\n// squatch.js must be initialized to call autofill, but user information is not required\n_sqh.push(['init', {\n   tenant_alias: '{{tenant alias}}'\n}]);\n\n// Check for a referral code\nvar autofillCb = function(code){\n   if(code) {\n   // if you have clicked the unique sharelink, there should be a referral code present and this alert will fire\n    \talert(\"This person was referred by: \" + code);\n    } else {\n    // if you have not followed a unique sharelink (so no referral cookie is present) this alert should fire\n    \talert(\"no referral code found\");\n    }\n};\n\n_sqh.push(['autofill',  autofillCb]);\n\n// Include squatch.js\n(function(){function l(){var s=document.createElement(\"script\");s.type=\"text/javascript\";s.async=true;s.src=location.protocol+\"//d2rcp9ak152ke1.cloudfront.net/assets/javascripts/squatch.min.js\";var t=document.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0];t.parentNode.insertBefore(s,t)}if(window.attachEvent){window.attachEvent(\"onload\",l)}else{window.addEventListener(\"load\",l,false)}})();\n</script>\n```\n#### [Mobile]\n\nThe Referral Code is stored in the [Branch integration’s](http://docs.referralsaasquatch.com/mobile/branch-metrics/) JSON format instead of a cookie on the user’s device:\n```\n  \"sq_referralCode\" : \"JANEDOE\",\n```\nIf a referral code is found, this means that this user has been referred and should receive their discount during the checkout process.\n\n#### Verify the referral code [optional]\nThe above code only checks to see if there is a referral code present. You can verify the referral code by using the [Lookup a Referral Code](http://docs.referralsaasquatch.com/api/methods/#get_code) API call. \n```\nType: GET\nURL: https://app.referralsaasquatch.com/api/v1/{{tenant alias}}/code/JANEDOE  \n```\nExample Response [Valid Referral Code]\n```\n{  \n   \"code\":\"JANEDOE\",\n   \"dateCreated\":1455752646974,\n   \"referrerName\":\"Jane Doe\",\n   \"reward\":{  \n      \"credit\":1000,\n      \"unit\":\"CENTS\",\n      \"type\":\"CREDIT\"\n   }\n}\n```\nExample Response [Invalid Referral Code]\n```\n{  \n   \"message\":\"Invalid referral code\",\n   \"statusCode\":404,\n   \"apiErrorCode\":\"REFERRAL_CODE_NOT_FOUND\"\n}\n```\n\n#### Reward Fulfillment \nIf the user was referred, apply a discount coupon during the checkout process so the referred user gets their reward.\n\n### 7b. Reward Fulfillment - Referred User [Percent Discount]\nDuring the referred user’s checkout process the referred user should have their reward applied. The following code examples help determine whether or not a user was referred. \n\n#### [Desktop]\nCheck for Referral Code cookie with [Squatch JS autofill](http://docs.referralsaasquatch.com/squatchjs/#autofill). If there is a Referral Code present, this means the user has been referred and should you should apply their discount during the checkout process.\n\nSquatch JS autofill example\nThe following code snippet will check for a referral code with a simple If / Else  statement. \n```\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\nvar _sqh = _sqh || [];\n\n// squatch.js must be initialized to call autofill, but user information is not required\n_sqh.push(['init', {\n   tenant_alias: '{{tenant alias}}'\n}]);\n\n// Check for a referral code\nvar autofillCb = function(code){\n   if(code) {\n   // if you have clicked the unique sharelink, there should be a referral code present and this alert will fire\n    \talert(\"This person was referred by: \" + code);\n    } else {\n    // if you have not followed a unique sharelink (so no referral cookie is present) this alert should fire\n    \talert(\"no referral code found\");\n    }\n};\n\n_sqh.push(['autofill',  autofillCb]);\n\n// Include squatch.js\n(function(){function l(){var s=document.createElement(\"script\");s.type=\"text/javascript\";s.async=true;s.src=location.protocol+\"//d2rcp9ak152ke1.cloudfront.net/assets/javascripts/squatch.min.js\";var t=document.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0];t.parentNode.insertBefore(s,t)}if(window.attachEvent){window.attachEvent(\"onload\",l)}else{window.addEventListener(\"load\",l,false)}})();\n</script>\n```\n#### [Mobile]\n\nThe Referral Code is stored in the [Branch integration’s](http://docs.referralsaasquatch.com/mobile/branch-metrics/) JSON format instead of a cookie on the user’s device:\n```\n  \"sq_referralCode\" : \"JANEDOE\",\n```\nIf a referral code is found, this means that this user has been referred and you should apply their discount during the checkout process.\n\n#### Verify the referral code [optional]\nThe above code only checks to see if there is a referral code present. You can verify the referral code by using the [Lookup a Referral Code API](http://docs.referralsaasquatch.com/api/methods/#get_code) call. \n```\nType: GET\nURL: https://app.referralsaasquatch.com/api/v1/{{tenant alias}}/code/JANEDOE  \n```\n#### Example Response [Valid Referral Code]\n```\n{\n  \"code\": \"JANEDOE\",\n  \"dateCreated\": 1465584764407,\n  \"referrerName\": \"Jane Doe \",\n  \"reward\": {\n    \"discountPercent\": 10,\n    \"monthsDiscountIsValid\": 1,\n    \"type\": \"PCT_DISCOUNT\"\n  }\n}\n```\nExample Response [Invalid Referral Code]\n```\n{  \n   \"message\":\"Invalid referral code\",\n   \"statusCode\":404,\n   \"apiErrorCode\":\"REFERRAL_CODE_NOT_FOUND\"\n}\n```\n\n#### Reward Fulfillment \nIf the user was referred, apply a discount coupon during the checkout process so the referred user gets their reward.\n\n### 8a. Reward Fulfillment - Referrer [Dollar Credit]\n#### Listen for Webhooks\n[Subscribe](https://docs.referralsaasquatch.com/api/methods/#create_webhook) a URL as a webhook endpoint to receive webhook events. \n\nHere you can listen for the creation of a reward for the referrer. The `reward.created` event will notify you whenever a new reward is created. \n\n#### Lookup the reward\nUse the [List reward balances API](http://docs.referralsaasquatch.com/api/methods/#list_balances) call to lookup the user’s available reward balance based on the `rewardId`, `accountId`, and `userId` in the webhook data.\n```\nType: GET\nURL: https://app.referralsaasquatch.com/api/v1/{{tenant_alias}}/reward/balance?accountId=abc_122 \n```\nExample response \n```\n{\n    \"count\": 1000,\n    \"totalAssignedCredit\": 1000,\n    \"totalRedeemedCredit\": 0,\n    \"unit\": \"CENTS\",\n    \"type\": \"CREDIT\"\n}\n```\nThis will give you the reward balance by calculating the difference between `totalAssignedCredit` and `totalRedeemedCredit`. In this example: \n\n`totalAssignedCredit` 1000 minus `totalRedeemedCredit` 0 equals 1000 CENTS available.\n\n#### Apply the reward\nThe calculated amount should be added onto the user’s next invoice. \n\n#### Redeem the reward \nUse the [Debit a reward balance API](http://docs.referralsaasquatch.com/api/methods/#debit_balance) call to debit the account’s reward balance. This will update the reward balance and the referral participant’s progress inside the Referral Widget. \n```\nType: POST\nURL: https://app.referralsaasquatch.com/api/v1/{{tenant_alias}}/credit/bulkredeem\n```\nJSON request\n```\n{\n    \"accountId\": \"abc_122\",\n    \"unit\": \"CENTS\",\n    \"amount\": 1000\n}\n```\nExample response \n```\n{\n   \"creditRedeemed\": 1000,\n   \"creditAvailable\": 0,\n   \"unit\": \"CENTS\"\n}\n```\n### 8b.

These modes both play important but different roles in the life of your program.  \n\nThe functionality of your live and test modes (tenants) are very similar with only minor variation to accommodate the slight differences in the uses of each of them.\n\nOn a usage level your test mode (tenant) is designed to be used in the process of setting up your program. Use this tenant when first intgrating your referral program, and when testign connections with platforms you integrate with. Your live tenant should only be used once you have completed all your testing and configuration and you are ready to launch your referral program for your customers to use.\n\nWhen making use of this guide, the majority of the functionality available in the portal can be performed in either the live or test tenants.\n\nDetails on best practices and [when to use your live or test tenant](/testing/) can be found in our developer docs.\n#### Test Data\nIn your test tenant you have to option to delete test data. \n\nData that **WILL** be deleted:\n- Users, accounts and referrals\n- Analytics events\n\nThe following data **WILL NOT** be deleted:\n- Any data stored in external payment systems (i.e. Stripe/Recurly)\n- Your SaaSquatch account (including users, settings, and API keys)\n- Your theme and widget customizations\n- Your program details (i.e. discount amount)\n\nTo access this functionality: \n- Select [Settings](#Program-Settings) under the Setup menu in the Sidebar\n- Click Delete Test Data,\n- Toggle the \"I would like to delete my test data\" toggle from no to yes\n- Click Delete.\n\n**Please note:** Live tenant’s do not provide the option to delete data.\n\n## Setup\nThe Setup section of the portal includes important information and values needed to configure your referral program, both before and after launch.  \n\n<div>\n<a class=\"docs-lightbox\" href=\"//images.contentful.com/s68ib1kj8k5n/4LoldQMuc0WegWm8akA8g/456679518bd993ef8ea06a376d689c7d/Sidebar_-_Setup.png\" data-lightbox=\"example-set\">\n  ![Sidebar - Setup](//images.contentful.com/s68ib1kj8k5n/4LoldQMuc0WegWm8akA8g/456679518bd993ef8ea06a376d689c7d/Sidebar_-_Setup.png)\n  <div><i class=\"fa fa-eye\"></i> Preview</div>\n</a>\n</div>\n\nHere you will find information and settings for:\n- The referral widget\n- Configuration options for referral email notifications\n- Integration information and configuration\n- Webhook configuration\n- Referral landing page settings\n\n### Referral Widget\nUnder the Setup heading on the Sidebar, select Referral Widget.\n\n<div>\n<a class=\"docs-lightbox\" href=\"//images.contentful.com/s68ib1kj8k5n/4uOvbzkXXiOe48iqCA8Ugy/08467db8a61e8fa14927bdfaeb6e6bd9/Plain_Test_Portal_-_Referral_Widget.png\" data-lightbox=\"example-set\">\n  ![Plain Test Portal - Referral Widget](//images.contentful.com/s68ib1kj8k5n/4uOvbzkXXiOe48iqCA8Ugy/08467db8a61e8fa14927bdfaeb6e6bd9/Plain_Test_Portal_-_Referral_Widget.png)\n  <div><i class=\"fa fa-eye\"></i> Preview</div>\n</a>\n</div>\n\nThis section of the portal will display a live render of your program's referral widget.

Currently our SDK cannot be used with payment system connectors such as Braintree, Stripe, Recurly, or Zuora.\n\nUsing the SDK, you can give your users just as good of an experience as you can on the desktop using our API. You can also use as much or as little of the SDK as you like. If you just want to create users in our system and connect them with their referrers, you can do that. If you want to show users what reward they will get if they sign up and offer a full history of referrals they've made and what state each referral is in, you can do that too.\n\nWith our SDK you can register your users with Referral SaaSquatch, track your user’s referrals, and fetch information about your users, referral codes and rewards.\n\nOur SDK can also be used with our [Branch integration](../branch-metrics) to provide an exceptional first user experience with a personalized landing page.\n\nSee the [quickstart guide](quickstart) for installation instructions.

                "en-US": "In this guide we’re going to provide you with a blueprint for organizing and implementing a robust referral program for your SaaS company. \n\nConsisting of three parts, this guide includes all the resources you need to successfully setup your own referral program.\n### SaaS and Referral Marketing\nThe real truth about referral marketing is that it’s actually one of the easiest and most effective forms of promotion, and the opportunities for marketers willing to take the plunge are significant.\n\nNot all forms of marketing are created equal. Certain channels for SaaS can build a flywheel effect for your company where they continually add new customers to your service every month. SaaS referral marketing is one of these organic channels that we've seen Dropbox, Evernote, Typeform and many other brands use to build profitable marketing campaigns.\n\nFor SaaS marketers, now is the ideal time to take advantage of this underutilized strategy. Referral marketing can be a highly effective and inexpensive form of customer acquisition and has the potential to be a huge traction channel for your SaaS company. Implementation can be easily achieved using Referral SaaSquatch, and results can be [tracked](/features/analytics) in real time. \n\nTo learn more about how referral marketing can benefit your SaaS business please take a look at our resources section:\n\n[![referral-saasquatch-blog-footer-cta-1024x411](//images.contentful.com/s68ib1kj8k5n/R4rWG2l3aeQCcY2OEQQ88/86af76192e318ebd7fa53f320dc39c1c/referral-saasquatch-blog-footer-cta-1024x411.png)](http://www.referralsaasquatch.com/resources/?utm_source=docs&utm_medium=resources&utm_campaign=saas%20program%20101)\n\n### Rewards\nSaaS businesses are extremely varied in what they do, so we've built Referral SaaSquatch to be extremely flexible and capable of supporting a wide range of referral program rewards. \n\nFor the purposes of this guide, we will be focusing on a referral program that makes use of either Percentage Discount, or Dollar Credit rewards. To find out more about other types of rewards that are available please check out some of our other [guides](/guides).\n### Referral Loop Example\nA full referral loop will include the following components:\n- [Engagement](/success/core-topics/#Engagement): Your existing user will interact with the referral program and share their referral link with friends and family\n- [Identification](/success/core-topics/#Identification): Referred users will visit your site and sign up for a free/trial account\n- [Attribution](#Attribution): Signup process will pick-up that user was referred and attribute the referral to the referrer\n- [Conversion](/success/core-topics/#Conversion): Referred user signs up for paid account, releasing a reward for referrer.\n- [Fulfillment](/success/core-topics/#fulfilment): Rewards for the referred user are fulfilled at upgrade, while rewards for the referrer are fulfilled once the referred user has converted to paid.\n\nYour existing users will commonly interact with your referral program through a [desktop](/squatchjs) or [mobile](/mobile/widget/) widget embedded in your product. From here they have the ability to track the progress of their referrals and [share](/success/share-options) their referral link or code with friends and family over social media, or email. Prospective referred users will click this link and be directed the the landing page you set for your referral program. Here they can follow your standard signup flow. When integrated into your signup flow, the Referral SaaSquatch tracking script will [identify](/success/core-topics/#Identification) the user to our system and attribute the referral to the correct referrer. When the referred user takes advantage of the referral reward to sign up for a paid subscription this will [convert](/success/core-topics/#Conversion) the referral to paid. The referrer will be notified of their successful referral and that their reward is available to them.\n\n### Next Steps\nThe [next part of this guide](/guides/saas-outline) outlines the structure of your new referral program following a similar structure to this example referral flow.\n### Additional Resources\nThe [Referral Program 101](/success/intro) article provides the basics of what a referral program is.\n\nMore about where your users will interact with your referral program can be found in our [Referral Marketing Channels](/success/touchpoints) article."

                "en-US": "### Installation\n\n\nThe minimum Android API required to use this SDK is 15.\n\nYou can install the latest version of the SDK from the maven repository, or download the aar and manually include the library.\n\n#### Install from the repository\n\nTo install the SDK from the maven repository, first include the repo in your *project's* `build.gradle` file:\n\n```gradle\n// ...\nallprojects {\n    repositories {\n        jcenter()\n        // Include the SDK maven repository\n        maven {\n            url 'https://github.com/saasquatch/mobile-sdk-android-maven/raw/master/'\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNext, add the dependency in your *module's* `build.gradle` file:\n\n```gradle\n// ...\ndependencies {\n    // ...\n    compile 'com.wholepunk.saasquatch:saasquatch-sdk-android:1.0.3'\n}\n```\n\nRun a gradle sync and the SDK is now ready for use in your project.\n\n#### Manual install\n\nThere are 2 steps to manually install the SDK in your app:\n\n* Import the library into your project.\n* Reference the library in your module's `build.gradle` file.\n\n##### Step 1: Import the library into your project\n\nTo add the SDK to your project, go to File -> New -> New Module.\n\nSelect *Import .JAR/.AAR Package* and hit \"Next\".\n\nClick the \"...\" button next to the *File name* field, and locate `saasquatch-release.aar` within the zip and select it. Click \"Finish\" and your project will include the `saasquatch-release` module.\n\n\n##### Step 2: Reference the library in your module's build.gradle file\n\nOpen up the `build.gradle` file for your module and add the following:\n\n```gradle\n// ...\ndependencies {\n    // ...\n    compile project(':saasquatch-release')\n}\n```\n\nRun a gradle sync and you will be able to use the SDK in your app.\n\n\n### Usage\n\n\nThe Referral SaaSquatch Android SDK allows us to:\n\n* Register our users with Referral SaaSquatch to track their referrals.\n* Track our user's referrals with Referral SaaSquatch.\n* Fetch information about our users, referral codes and rewards.\n\n\nTo demonstrate how to use the SDK, let's walk through registering a user with Referral SaaSquatch and making a referral as demoed in our [Sample App](https://github.com/saasquatch/mobile-sdk-android-sample \"Sample App\"). This can be achieved by following these steps:\n\n* Register our new user with Referral SaaSquatch.\n* Look up a referral code provided by our user during sign up.\n* Apply the referral to our user's account.\n* Show our user come information about the user who referred them.\n\n#### Register a user with Referral SaaSquatch\n\nTo register a user, we provide user information to Referral SaaSquatch. We provide our tenant alias which identifies our app. A userId from our system is passed to SaaSquatch to uniquely identify our users. We pass in an accountId, which Referral SaaSquatch uses to group users together; see [Shared vs Solo Accounts](/shared-vs-solo-accounts/ \"Shared vs Solo Accounts\") to see what you should use here.\nLastly, we provide a valid JSONObject containing information about our user. For a description of the available `userInfo` fields, please see [SaaSquatch docs](../../../api/methods/#open_create_user \"Referral SaaSquatch REST API reference\"). Here is an example:\n\n```java\n// This is your tenant alias which identifies you with Referral SaaSquatch\nString tenant = \"SaaS\";\n\n// We register our user internally, then pass the user's information to Referral SaaSquatch\nString userId = \"000001\";\nString accountId = \"000001\";\nJSONObject userInfo = new JSONObject();\ntry {\n    userInfo.put(\"id\", userId);\n    userInfo.put(\"accountId\", accountId);\n    userInfo.put(\"email\", \"claire@lallybroch.com\");\n    userInfo.put(\"firstName\", \"Claire\");\n    userInfo.put(\"lastName\", \"Fraser\");\n    userInfo.put(\"locale\", \"en_US\");\n    userInfo.put(\"referralCode\", \"CLAIREFRASER\");\n} catch (JSONException e) {\n    Log.e(\"MyActivity\", e.getLocalizedMessage());\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, we assign an id of 000001 since Claire is our first user. We pass her email, first and last names, and her locale to Referral SaaSquatch. We have also assigned her a referral code so she can use it to refer new users. When a new user signs up with referral code \"CLAIREFRASER\" she will get the credit.\n\nNow we can register our user with Referral SaaSquatch using this call:\n\n```java\n// Register a user with Referral Saasquatch\nSaasquatch.registerUser(tenant, userId, accountId, token, userInfo, this,\n    new Saasquatch.TaskCompleteListener() {\n        @Override\n        public void onComplete(JSONObject userInfo, String errorMessage, Integer errorCode) {\n\n            // Code to be executed after the async task returns\n        }\n    });\n```\n\nWe provide a `TaskCompleteListener` which will be called with `userInfo`, `errorMessage` and `errorCode`. The JSONObject `userInfo` contains the returned information about the user. If there was an error, `errorMessage` contains a description of what went wrong, and `errorCode` contains an Integer indicating the HTTP status code returned by the server, or 0 if there was some other error. If `errorMessage` and `errorCode` are null then `userInfo` will exist and vice versa.\n\nIn our listener, we will parse through the returned data and save anything useful for later.\n\n```java\npublic void onComplete(JSONObject userInfo, String errorMessage, Integer errorCode) {\n\n    // First, check if an error occurred\n    if (errorCode != null) {\n        // handle errors\n    }\n\n    // If the error is null, then userInfo will exist\n    if (userInfo != null) {\n\n        // We would like to save the share links returned by the Referral SaaSquatch server.\n        JSONObject shareLinks;\n        String shareLink;\n        String facebookShareLink;\n        String twitterShareLink;\n\n        try {\n            shareLinks = userInfo.getJSONObject(\"shareLinks\");\n            shareLink = shareLinks.getString(\"shareLink\");\n            facebookShareLink = shareLinks.getString(\"mobileFacebookShareLink\");\n            twitterShareLink = shareLinks.getString(\"mobileTwitterShareLink\");\n        } catch (JSONException e) {\n            Log.e(\"MyActivity\", e.getLocalizedMessage());\n            return;\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### Make the referral\n\nOnce the user is registered and any useful information returned in `userInfo` has been saved away, we will make their referral with Referral SaaSquatch. We'll call `applyReferralCode` with the code our user gave us and their userId, accountId and token. The function validates the referral code. If the code is successful the reward information will be returned in `userInfo`, or if the code cannot be applied to the account an error will be returned.\n\n\n```java\nSaasquatch.applyReferralCode(tenant, userId, accountId, \"BOBTESTERSON\", token, MyActivity.this,\n    new Saasquatch.TaskCompleteListener() {\n        @Override\n        public void onComplete(JSONObject userInfo, String errorMessage, Integer errorCode) {\n\n            // First, check the error\n            if (errorCode != null) {\n                // handle errors\n            }\n\n            // Parse the referral code information returned in userInfo\n            JSONObject reward;\n            String type;\n            String discountPercent;\n\n            try {\n                reward = userInfo.getJSONObject(\"reward\");\n                type = reward.getString(\"type\");\n            } catch (JSONException e) {\n                Log.e(\"MyActivity\", e.getLocalizedMessage());\n                return;\n            }\n\n            // For a complete list of reward types and fields, please visit http://docs.referralsaasquatch.com/api/methods/#open_apply_code\n            if (type.equals(\"PCT_DISCOUNT\")) {\n                try {\n                    discountPercent = reward.getString(\"discountPercent\");\n                } catch (JSONException e) {\n                    Log.e(\"MyActivity\", e.getLocalizedMessage());\n                    return;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    });\n```\n\nDuring your user's registration, you may want to look up a referral code they entered to check it's existance and get information about the associated reward. The call is very similar to applyReferralCode and returns the same reward information in userInfo. The tenant, referral code and context are the only required parameters, but if you make too many calls without a token you may get a 401: Unauthorized response.\n\nFor a complete description of the available fields, visit the [SaaSquatch docs](../../../api/methods/#open_apply_code \"Referral SaaSquatch REST API reference\").\n\n```java\nSaasquatch.lookupReferralCode(tenant, \"BOBTESTERSON\", token, MyActivity.this,\n    new Saasquatch.TaskCompleteListener() {\n        @Override\n        public void onComplete(JSONObject userInfo, String errorMessage, Integer errorCode) {\n\n            // Parse the reward as in applyReferralCode above\n        }\n    })\n```\n\n\n#### Lookup who referred our user\n\nThe last thing we would like to do is let our user know they have been referred successfully. Let's lookup the user that referred them so we can let our user know who they can thank. For this, we can use the `getUserByReferralCode` method like this:\n\n```java\nSaasquatch.getUserByReferralCode(tenant, \"BOBTESTERSON\", token, MyActivity.this,\n    new Saasquatch.TaskCompleteListener() {\n        @Overried\n        public void onComplete(JSONObject userInfo, String errorMessage, Integer errorCode) {\n\n            // Always check the error\n            if (errorCode != null) {\n                // handle errors\n            }\n\n            // Parse the returned information\n            String referrerFirstName;\n            String referrerLastInitial;\n            String referrerImageURL;\n\n            try {\n                referrerFirstName = userInfo.getString(\"firstName\");\n                referrerLastInitial = userInfo.getString(\"lastInitial\");\n                referrerImageURL = userInfo.getString(\"imageUrl\");\n            } catch (JSONException e) {\n                Log.e(\"MyActivity\", e.getLocalizedMessage());\n                return;\n            }\n        }\n    });\n```         \n\nGreat! We registered our new user with Referral SaaSquatch and successfully made a referral.\n\n#### List Referrals\n\nLet's add one more bit of functionality to our app to demonstrate `listReferralsForTenant`. Bob Testerson referred our new user, Claire Fraser, and we would like to show him a list of everyone he's referred (it's a lot). To do this, we call `listReferralsForTenant`.\n\nThis method looks up all the referrals for us, the tenant. The other required parameter is a token to authenticate the request. The remainder of the parameters are options for filtering this list. In this case, we want to list only the referrals where Bob is the *referrer*. We will pass in Bob's userId and accountId and parse the list returned in `userInfo`. For a description of the options for filtering, see the [SaaSquatch\ndocs](../../../api/methods/#open_list_referrals \"Referral SaaSquatch REST API reference\").\n\n```java\nSaasquatch.listReferralsForTenant(tenant, token, bobsAccountId, bobsUserId, null, null, null, null, null, null, MyActivity.this,\n    new Saasquatch.TaskCompleteListener() {\n\n        @Override\n        public void onComplete(JSONObject userInfo, String errorMessage, Integer errorCode) {\n\n            if (errorCode != null) {\n                // handle errors\n            }\n\n            JSONArray referrals;\n\n            try {\n                referrals = userInfo.getJSONArray(\"referrals\");\n            } catch (JSONException e) {\n                Log.e(\"MyActivity\", e.getLocalizedMessage());\n            }\n\n            for (int i = 0; i < referrals.length(); i++) {\n                try {\n                    JSONObject referredUser = referrals.getJSONObject(i).getJSONObject(\"referredUser\");\n                    String firstName = referredUser.getString(\"firstName\");\n                    JSONObject referredReward = referrals.getJSONObject(i).getJSONObject(\"referredReward\");\n\n                    // In this case, we are giving out only percent discount rewards, so we know this field will exist\n                    String discountPercent = referredReward.getInt(\"discountPercent\");\n                } catch (JSONException e) {\n                    break;\n                }\n\n                // Do something with the reward information\n            }\n        }\n    })\n```\n\n\n### Done!\n\nFor a working demo implementation, check out our [Sample App](https://github.com/saasquatch/mobile-sdk-android-sample \"Sample App\").\n\nFor a detailed description of the `Saasquatch` class and it's public methods, please visit the [API Docs](../docs/ \"API level docs\").\n\nFor a reference of the fields available in `userInfo` please visit the [Referral SaaSquatch REST API docs](../../../api/methods/#open_create_user \"Referral SaaSquatch REST API docs\").\n"

RS for Salesforce automatically loads user records into Salesforce as a separate custom object called __SaaSquatch User__. These records are then linked to a Lead or Contact when the email address matches. Leads and Contacts automatically have their custom fields and related lists updated based upon the matched record.\n\n### How are duplicates handled?\n\n - __Duplicate Contact or Leads in Salesforce__ - RS for Salesforce links the first record with the right email address.\n - __Leads that a duplicates Contact__ - RS for Salesforce links to Contacts first and Leads second.\n - __Merging duplicates__ - RS for Salesforce will map to the merged record only if it has the right email address.\n - __Updating Email__ - RS for Salesforce will immediately relink a record when an email address changed.\n\n### Why isn't a user syncing to Salesforce?\n\nHere are some reasons a Lead or Contact is not getting linked:\n\n- A __Validation Rule__ on your Lead or Contact record is prevent RS for Salesforce from updating records.\n- A __SaaSquatch User__ has been created, but the email address in SaaSquatch doesn't exactly match the email of the Lead or Contact.\n\n### Does it work with Salesforce Lightning Experience?\n\nYes, Referral SaaSquatch for Salesforce will work out of the box with both Salesforce Classic and Salesforce Lightning Experience.\n\n### Which Salesforce Editions do you support?\n\nOur integration uses the Salesforce Bulk API for efficient loading and synchronization of large data sets, so we only support Professional, Enterprise, Performance and Unlimited Editions.\n\n### What other features should I know about?\n\nHere are some important features to know about:\n - Supports synchronization of historical data. Turn it on or off at any point.\n - Use custom fields to simplify integration into your Marketing Automation systems like Marketo, Hubspot and Pardot.\n - Works with __custom salesforce reports__, __process builder__, __workflow rules__ and the other Salesforce tools you're used to using.\n - Support conversion tracking customization. Conversions can be triggered on Opportunity Won, based off custom Process Builder actions, based on any arbitrary APEX event or Trigger, or external conversion events using the SaaSquatch REST API\n - Self-healing linking will automatically heal the link between SaaSquatch and Salesforce if a Lead or Contact is Merged, Converted or Deleted\n - Attribution tracking persists into Opportunities when a Lead is converted\n - Works with both Inbound Referral and Outbound Referral workflows\n"

                "en-US": "The marketing channels (or touchpoints) of a referral program are all the components of your referral program that your users will interact with. These include the desktop and mobile widget, notification emails, share messages, and marketing emails. \n\nFor a referral program to be successful it is crucial that each of these components is providing a unified, clear, and concise message about how the referral program works; the user’s progress within it; and what the user needs to do next. When users are well-informed about the availability of a referral program, what the program offers, and how to get involved, it makes it easier for them to start making successful referrals. \n\nThe sections below discuss the touchpoint components of a referral program, the role they each play, and how your users will be interacting with them.\n### Widgets\nThe Referral Saasquatch platform provides a responsive widget for users to access. The widget is a one-stop-shop for your users to participate in the referral program; they can refer friends, track the status of their referrals, and see the rewards earned from referrals.This can be surfaced anywhere users can be identified on your website and used to track users for registration, display the widget, and more. \n#### Desktop Widget\nThe responsive desktop widget provides full support for the Referral SaaSquatch themes which allow you to customize your referral program to pixel-perfect brand constraints. The desktop widget can either be served as a popup / modal window, or embedded directly into the page. \n\n<div>\n<a class=\"docs-lightbox\" href=\"//images.contentful.com/s68ib1kj8k5n/1lORITdPfyMQWkqY2gosE4/1117d2d91ab9d230300828318f25e8e4/referral_widget_live.png\" data-lightbox=\"example-set\">\n  ![referral widget live](//images.contentful.com/s68ib1kj8k5n/1lORITdPfyMQWkqY2gosE4/1117d2d91ab9d230300828318f25e8e4/referral_widget_live.png)\n  <div><i class=\"fa fa-eye\"></i> Preview</div>\n</a>\n</div>\n\nDetails about [theming](/themes/) your widget and complete install [guides](/guides/) for integrating our referral widget into your website or mobile app, are available in the documentation.\n#### Mobile Widget\nReferral SaaSquatch provides a fully responsive mobile widget that can be embedded directly into your iOS, Android, or Windows phone mobile apps. \n\n<div>\n<a class=\"docs-lightbox\" href=\"//images.contentful.com/s68ib1kj8k5n/3dnC1OlCBOMAcAG884q2uc/714245d74b13b856c22da9a5b289a323/referral_widget_live_mobile.png\" data-lightbox=\"example-set\">\n  ![referral widget live mobile](//images.contentful.com/s68ib1kj8k5n/3dnC1OlCBOMAcAG884q2uc/714245d74b13b856c22da9a5b289a323/referral_widget_live_mobile.png)\n  <div><i class=\"fa fa-eye\"></i> Preview</div>\n</a>\n</div>\n\nIncluding the referral widget into your mobile app can be as simple as including a user’s personalized URL in a WebView or iFrame component. This will load a mobile-responsive web page as part of your app, look after the referral tracking, and let your users refer their friends.\n\nFor complete control over the look and experience of your referral program in your app we provide a comprehensive [Mobile SDK](/mobile/). The Mobile SDK, available on our enterprise plans, allows you to build your referral programs natively into your mobile applications on iOS and Android.\nDetails about including the widget in your mobile app, configuring the mobile widget theme, the Mobile SDK, and examples of implementations on iOS and Android are available in the [documentation](/mobile/).\n### Share Messages\nReferral SaaSquatch widget and email themes let you [Customize Your Referral Program](/success/share-options/) to allow your users to share their referral link on Facebook, Twitter, or by email with ease. The Referral SaaSquatch social media integration helps reducing the friction for users looking to share their referral link by not requiring users to authorize access to their Facebook or Twitter account in order to share their post.\n\n<div>\n<a class=\"docs-lightbox\" href=\"//images.contentful.com/s68ib1kj8k5n/5xZa7pLe5qcE60G6WKaUgW/97872e44b893f0e7e5b5fc0f1a9ed6ae/tile_facebook_share_message_example.png\" data-lightbox=\"example-set\"> ![tile facebook share message example](//images.contentful.com/s68ib1kj8k5n/5xZa7pLe5qcE60G6WKaUgW/97872e44b893f0e7e5b5fc0f1a9ed6ae/tile_facebook_share_message_example.png) <div><i class=\"fa fa-eye\"></i> Preview</div> <a class=\"docs-lightbox\" href=\"//images.contentful.com/s68ib1kj8k5n/5IZKIyX2jCo42Uq4wc8UsW/c62dd4726c2e9199e6a0354c4f295ac2/tile_twitter_share_message_example.png\" data-lightbox=\"example-set\"> ![tile twitter share message example](//images.contentful.com/s68ib1kj8k5n/5IZKIyX2jCo42Uq4wc8UsW/c62dd4726c2e9199e6a0354c4f295ac2/tile_twitter_share_message_example.png) <div><i class=\"fa fa-eye\" ></i> Preview</div> <a class=\"docs-lightbox\" href=\"//images.contentful.com/s68ib1kj8k5n/7iCU1mPbfGaKGq6MYsWgkQ/b8fb509cbb057542fcc67df7f664b098/email_share.png\" data-lightbox=\"example-set\"> ![email share](//images.contentful.com/s68ib1kj8k5n/7iCU1mPbfGaKGq6MYsWgkQ/b8fb509cbb057542fcc67df7f664b098/email_share.png) <div><i class=\"fa fa-eye\"></i> Preview</div>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\nWithin the Referral SaaSquatch portal, you can provide pre-written messaging for all social sharing options to ensure that essentials like the user’s unique sharelink are included correctly, and that the messaging is captivating and relevant. User’s can still edit the posts, but providing a solid starting point can help improve program performance.  You can also update the messaging any time, to maintain consistency with other promotions or seasonal offerings. \n\n### Notification Emails\nReferral SaaSquatch provides a complete [notification email](/topics/email/#Email-Notifications) service for your referral program. \n\n<div>\n<a class=\"docs-lightbox\" href=\"//images.contentful.com/s68ib1kj8k5n/3kY9y28NlSuGeMWMUCG8yu/0f6bf73f89147f629986a4502f521ba3/parkwhiz_referral_complete_email.png\" data-lightbox=\"example-set\">\n  ![parkwhiz referral complete email](//images.contentful.com/s68ib1kj8k5n/3kY9y28NlSuGeMWMUCG8yu/0f6bf73f89147f629986a4502f521ba3/parkwhiz_referral_complete_email.png)\n  <div><i class=\"fa fa-eye\"></i> Preview</div>\n</a>\n</div>\n\nEmail notifications are available to be sent whenever a referred user signs up for a new trial or free account, and then again whenever a referral is converted. These notifications allow the referrer to keep track of the progress of their referrals and be notified when they have earned their reward. By default, the notification emails also include referral program sharing options, to further incentivize participation. \n\nPro and Enterprise accounts are able to utilize the theme engine to fully customize the email HTML and CSS, to perfectly match your transactional or marketing email templates and branding. \n### Marketing Emails\nMarketing, blast, or mass emails are a great way to promote your referral program to your existing user base or email subscription list. Pro and Enterprise customers can make use of the Referral SaaSquatch mass user import functionality. By providing a list of existing users, Referral SaaSquatch will register them and return an export with their unique share links. This data can be imported into an email platform, like Mailchimp, where the share links can be utilized as merge variables. Individual share links can also be looked up using an [API call](/api/methods/#get_sharelinks) for use in personalized emails. These powerful tools make it possible to deliver emails with all the information user’s need to participate in your referral program directly from their inbox!\n\n### Additional Information\n\nThese touchpoints tie in closely with the structure of a referral program that is covered in our [How Referral SaaSquatch Works](/success/core-topics/) article. \n\nTo learn more about referral programs and how to get your program up and running, check out our [Referral Program 101](/success/intro/) article."

                "en-US": "### How do I use the Segment integration?\n\nSegment customers can use the Segment [analytics.js](https://segment.com/docs/sources/website/analytics.js/) library instead of directly using the [Squatch.js](/squatchjs) Referral SaaSquatch javascript library.\n\nUse the analytics.js [identify](https://segment.com/docs/methods/identify) method instead of [squatch.js init](/squatchjs#init) call to identify the currently logged in user and set up SaaSquatch.\n\nBelow is a comparison of a squatch.js init call vs the equivalent Segment analytics.js identify call.\n\n<table class=\"table\">\n    <tr>\n        <th>\n            Squatch.js\n        </th>\n        <th>\n            Segment / analytics.js\n        </th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>\n            Use <a href=\"/squatchjs#init\">squatch.js init</a>\n        </td>\n        <td>\n            Use <a href=\"https://segment.com/docs/methods/identify\">analytics.js identify</a>\n        </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-js\">_sqh.push([\"init\", {\n    tenant_alias: \"test_aaaexampleaaa\",\n    user_id: \"u1234\",\n    account_id: \"a5678\",\n    email: \"joe.tester@example.com\",\n    user_image: \"http://example.com/avatar/205e460b479e2e\",\n    first_name: \"Joe\",\n    last_name: \"Tester\",\n    user_referral_code: \"JOETESTER\",\n    mode: \"EMBED\",\n    account_status: \"PAID\",\n    locale: \"en_US\",\n    fb_share_image: \"http://www.example.com/logo.png\",\n    checksum: \"arbPDAcedO38Qw/qdJLCqd2tlRQ=\"\n}]);</code></pre>\n                </td>\n                <td>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-js\">analytics.identify( \"u1234\", {\n    accountId: \"a5678\",\n    email: \"joe.tester@example.com\",\n    avatar: \"http://example.com/avatar/205e460b479e2e\",\n    firstName: \"Joe\",\n    lastName: \"Tester\",\n    userReferralCode: \"JOETESTER\",\n    mode: \"EMBED\",\n    accountStatus: \"PAID\",\n    locale: \"en_US\",\n    referralImage: \"http://www.example.com/logo.png\",\n    paymentProviderId: 'cus_8rVOAthroptvT6'\n},{\n    integrations: {\n        SaaSquatch: {\n            checksum: 'n3VtXg92TVOuzQ+6EMV8FvjY4em5NptCcesDYv+9tegs='\n        }\n    }\n});</code></pre>\n        </td>\n    </tr>\n\n</table>\n\n* * *\n\n### What features are supported with Segment?\n\nMost of the features of the Referral SaaSquatch squatch.js library are released immediately for Segment. You can always use squatch.js directly to [open](/squatchjs#open) or [close](/squatchjs#close) the referral widget. However, there will always be some things that will require you to use squatch.js directly.  \n\n**Note:** \n- To set `paymentProviderId` as `null` it must be set as `'null'`. E.g. `paymentProviderId: 'null',`\n- Some of the parameters are named differently in squatch.js vs analytics.js. For example, use `avatar` to add an image for a user instead of `user_image`\n* * *\n\n### How do I use Signed Requests with Segment.io?\n\nYou can still use [Signed Requests](/squatchjs/signed-requests) with Segment, keeping in mind a few things:\n\n*   Only Checksums, not JWTs, are currently supported for use with signed requests made using Segment\n*   Include `tenant_alias` in the checksum\n*   Omit other analytics.js traits from the checksum, such as Google Analytics ids\n*   Ordering is based upon [squatch.js init](/squatchjs#init) parameters names, not the analytics.js parameter names. For example, `avatar` should still be sorted with \"u\" for `user_image`\n\n* * *\n\n### Can I used the REST API with Segment?\n\nNo, at this time the Segment integration with Referral SaaSuatch is only an abstractions of the squatch.js javascript library. \n\n* * *\n\n### Where can I find more information?\n\nSegment provides [support documents](https://segment.com/docs/integrations/saasquatch/) about their integration with Referral SaaSquatch. You can also check out the full source code for the integration on [Segment's Github](https://github.com/segment-integrations/analytics.js-integration-saasquatch)."

                "en-US": "To better understand how a referral program works we have broken the process down into five core topics; Engagement, Identification, Attribution, Conversion, Fulfilment. These cover the complete referral process from beginning (user discovery) to end (fulfilling rewards). \n\n<div>\n<a class=\"docs-lightbox\" href=\"//images.contentful.com/s68ib1kj8k5n/Z9qkeFmrgkE0KGoOEWiwK/f6ee70af052e66677f278697b5d688e2/core_topics_updated_flow.png\" data-lightbox=\"example-set\">\n  ![core topics updated flow](//images.contentful.com/s68ib1kj8k5n/Z9qkeFmrgkE0KGoOEWiwK/f6ee70af052e66677f278697b5d688e2/core_topics_updated_flow.png)\n  <div><i class=\"fa fa-eye\"></i> Preview</div>\n</a>\n</div>\n\n### Engagement\nThe engagement component of the referral process is all about figuring out how to best interact with existing customers. In order to direct a user's attention towards your referral program you should take advantage of channels that they interact with everyday. The referral widget can both be embedded and served as a popup or modal, and the more visible and easy to access your program is, the better results you will see. \n\nPromotion is something that all referral programs need in order to deliver results as you have to create awareness of your referral program to drive participation. In most cases, promoting your referral program to existing customers across a wide range of mediums will help with the visibility of your program and drive engagement.\n \nOn your website or in app; banners, visible referral pages, triggered calls to action, push notifications, and dedicated emails will all increase the visibility of your referral program. Including a footer in your other emails for invoice receipts, reminders, blog articles, and support tickets can also increase awareness of the referral program. A referral program will benefit from promotion across any or all of these channels. \n### Identification\nThis step is where users are enrolled for inclusion in your referral program. With a user registered in your referral program they are able to start making referrals by sharing out their referral link to family and friends.\n\nEnrolling a user in your referral program requires providing Referral SaaSquatch with identifying information about the user such as name, email, and a unique account and user id. The identification step typically happens whenever a user first creates an account on your website or service, makes a purchase, or logs in.\n\nOnce a user has been identified and engages with the referral program the referral process can continue towards Attribution and Conversion. \n### Attribution\nAttribution is the process of building a referral link between two people; the person doing the referring, and the person that was referred. In this step your referral program establishes the connection between these two users. \n\nThe process of attributing this referral of a new user is done automatically through Referral SaaSquatch as part of a correctly configured program. Links and referral codes shared directly, by email, or through social media work across desktop or mobile devices and seamlessly attribute the referral connection between the referrer and the referred user. \n\nOnce the referral connection is made Referral SaaSquatch will send the referrer an email notifying them of the progress of the user they referred. Subsequent steps in the referral process will be accurately applied to both the referrer and referred user with the referral connection correctly attributed.\n### Conversion\nThe conversion step is where the goal-post of your referral program is achieved. This goal-post is the ultimate objective of your referral program. Many organizations have this event as the point at which a referred user pays for a subscription. Other organizations have their goal-post as when a referred user signs up for a free account, or when a referred user makes a purchase of a certain value. This target is flexible and can be tailored to your specific business needs. \n\nIn Referral SaaSquatch, user’s have 3 possible Account Statuses, TRIAL, PAID, and CANCELLED. A TRIAL user, is one that has been identified, but hasn’t reached the goal-post of the program, this is typically when they first create an account with you. When a TRIAL user is converted to PAID, any associated referrals will be converted. This means that if they were referred, rewards will be generated for the person who referred them. It also means that if they were not referred, they are considered a full paying customer and will not be able to be referred later. This status update can be done in several ways, including using our JavaScript library, mobile widgets, or REST API, or manually through your Referral SaaSquatch program’s web portal. \n\nOnce the goal-post has been hit, and the user’s status has been updated, the referral process can progress to fulfillment. \n### Fulfillment\nFulfillment is the process of making sure people are able to use the rewards they earn. Referral SaaSquatch supports manual, semi-automated, and fully-automated reward fulfillment options. Rewards rewards come in many shapes and sizes but are commonly discount percentages, account credits, gift cards, or points. \n\nReferral SaaSuatch supports integrations with a range of payment providers and reward systems to fulfill rewards. Integrations with payment providers allow for seamless inclusion of the rewards with your existing billing platform. Highly customized referral reward solutions are also possible through our API-based referral programs. \n\nThe easiest way to learn more about the topic of fulfillment is to start by exploring our getting started [guides](/guides/). These guides provide step-by-step instructions for how to implement some of the most popular types of referral program rewards."

More information about ways to engage with your existing user and how to drive participation in your referral program can be found in our [Referral Marketing Channels](/success/touchpoints/) article in the Success Centre. \n\n<div>\n<a class=\"docs-lightbox\" href=\"//images.contentful.com/s68ib1kj8k5n/3zt4XxP1KgsUaaYWCym6As/3f21d4d0f417b16231c645c0b4e901c4/referral_widget.png\" data-lightbox=\"example-set\">\n  ![referral widget](//images.contentful.com/s68ib1kj8k5n/3zt4XxP1KgsUaaYWCym6As/3f21d4d0f417b16231c645c0b4e901c4/referral_widget.png)\n  <div><i class=\"fa fa-eye\"></i> Preview</div>\n</a>\n</div>\n\nThere are five main methods users have access to for sharing a referral with their friends and family; referral code, referral link, Facebook, Twitter, and email. This guide covers how each of these sharing methods works with Referral SaaSquatch, examples, and the benefits of each platform.\n### Code\nWhen a user is registered in our system they are provided a unique referral code. This code typically comes in the form of FIRSTNAMELASTNAME, such as JOHNDOE. By default the referral code is shown in the referral widget right underneath the main text.\n\n<div>\n<a class=\"docs-lightbox\" href=\"//images.contentful.com/s68ib1kj8k5n/tw5Z7FRkPeCwM2S4Gg0wS/56600567173286e8581f068191142f21/referral_widget_code.png\" data-lightbox=\"example-set\">\n![referral widget code](//images.contentful.com/s68ib1kj8k5n/tw5Z7FRkPeCwM2S4Gg0wS/56600567173286e8581f068191142f21/referral_widget_code.png)\n<div><i class=\"fa fa-eye\"></i> Preview</div>\n</a>\n</div>\n\nThe referral code provides a simple method for users to connect with your referral program. They are a relatively short human-readable code which users can share with their friends and family. Many people are familiar with the concept of a coupon code so using the referral codes as part of your referral program can make the process easier to understand.\n\nThe main limitation of this share option is that it does not take advantage of our automatic referral attribution. The referred user is required to manually input the referral code on your referral landing page. This mean that referred users could forget the code, or have take the extra step of  copying and pasting it. Referral codes can be hidden for products that do not have a coupon or code input field. \n\n### Links\nWhen a user is registered in your referral program they are also provided a unique link to share with their friends and family. Sharing this referral link provides your customers an easy way to connect their friends with your platform by directing them to a referral landing page of your choice. \n\nThe referral links can be found in the user’s widget where they can copy it for sharing with family and friends. The main advantage of referral links is that the referral can be attributed automatically by our squatch.js tracking script. The referral link includes all the information needed to track the referral so there is no need for the referred user to worry about inputting a referral code.\n\nYou can set the destination for referral links on the Settings page of the Setup section of your Referral SaaSquatch portal. This destination can be changed at any time and will even update any user share links that have already been shared.\n\n<div>\n<a class=\"docs-lightbox\" href=\"//images.contentful.com/s68ib1kj8k5n/71g9oDl9sIMiQIaoQe4ucO/89d159a3871cc2cdc92598106e1297c0/referral_widget_link.png\" data-lightbox=\"example-set\">\n![referral widget link](//images.contentful.com/s68ib1kj8k5n/71g9oDl9sIMiQIaoQe4ucO/89d159a3871cc2cdc92598106e1297c0/referral_widget_link.png)\n<div><i class=\"fa fa-eye\"></i> Preview</div>\n</a>\n</div>\n\nAn example of what one of these links look like is: ssqt.co/barYS\n\nBy default Referral SaaSquatch generates these unique links using the ssqt.co short domain. Information on how to use your own domain rather than the default ssqt.co domain can be found in our [documentation](/customshortdomainguide/).\n### Share Messages\nShare messages provide your customers an opportunity to share their referral experience with their friends and family using a number of platforms including Facebook, Twitter, and Email.\nIn each user’s personalized referral widget and notification emails there are sharing options for each of the three supported platforms.\nEach of these options includes a platform specific, unique share link which can be used to track share traffic by platform.\n#### Facebook and Twitter\nFacebook and Twitter sharing options allow a referral user to make a post to their social media profile. The share messages themselves are extensively customizable, with settings for editing default share message content in your program portal. This lets you provide your users with a pre-formatted starting point for their shares. \n\nFriction is minimal as we do not require users to authorize access to their account to make the post.\n\n<div>\n<a class=\"docs-lightbox\" href=\"//images.contentful.com/s68ib1kj8k5n/4Oed6VvJ9egQcaGESi6o88/262315336d01d54968fb3f7964da0599/facebook_share_messaging_options.png\" data-lightbox=\"example-set\">\n![facebook share messaging options](//images.contentful.com/s68ib1kj8k5n/4Oed6VvJ9egQcaGESi6o88/262315336d01d54968fb3f7964da0599/facebook_share_messaging_options.png) <div><i class=\"fa fa-eye\"></i> Preview</div> <a class=\"docs-lightbox\" href=\"//images.contentful.com/s68ib1kj8k5n/4oRHdLbUakEoQuOkgMy06O/3fcae2a2f6d6c873e89818ca7a3c23a7/twitter_share_messaging_options.png\" data-lightbox=\"example-set\">![twitter share messaging options](//images.contentful.com/s68ib1kj8k5n/4oRHdLbUakEoQuOkgMy06O/3fcae2a2f6d6c873e89818ca7a3c23a7/twitter_share_messaging_options.png)\n<div><i class=\"fa fa-eye\"></i> Preview</div>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n\nConfigurable options for Facebook share messages include the message subject, body, and image.

Twitter image thumbnails can also be included on the sharetweets! The size of in-stream photo’s on twitter is 440x220px.\n\n<div>\n<a class=\"docs-lightbox\" href=\"//images.contentful.com/s68ib1kj8k5n/5IZKIyX2jCo42Uq4wc8UsW/c62dd4726c2e9199e6a0354c4f295ac2/tile_twitter_share_message_example.png\" data-lightbox=\"example-set\">\n![tile twitter share message example](//images.contentful.com/s68ib1kj8k5n/5IZKIyX2jCo42Uq4wc8UsW/c62dd4726c2e9199e6a0354c4f295ac2/tile_twitter_share_message_example.png)\n<div><i class=\"fa fa-eye\"></i> Preview</div>\n</a>\n</div>\n\nTo change Facebook and Twitter share images please let the [success team](mailto:success@referralsaaquatch.com) know.\n#### Email\nUsers are also able to make a referral by sharing their sharelink through email. The email share link in the widget is a standard \"mailto:\" link which lets users complete the share process through their email client of choice. In their email client the referrer can then simply input the email address of the desired recipient and make any personalizations to your referral program's standard email message.\n\nThis default messaging can be customized just like that of the Facebook and Twitter share options. Configurable options for the email share messages include the message subject and body text.\n\n<div>\n<a class=\"docs-lightbox\" href=\"//images.contentful.com/s68ib1kj8k5n/3IpX4cwrxugcayCYemCO0O/8c1ebe5e0d3c48c01e242b70c605d947/email_share_message_options.png\" data-lightbox=\"example-set\">\n![email share message options](//images.contentful.com/s68ib1kj8k5n/3IpX4cwrxugcayCYemCO0O/8c1ebe5e0d3c48c01e242b70c605d947/email_share_message_options.png)\n<div><i class=\"fa fa-eye\"></i> Preview</div>\n</a>\n</div>\n\nWhile formatting is limited to plain text, allowing users to send the email through their own email account provides a more personalized experience for both the referrer and referred user, and will consistently arrive in the recipient's general inbox, not the promotions folder.\n\nMore information about ways to engage with your existing user and how to drive participation in your referral program can be found in our [Referral Marketing Channels](/success/touchpoints/) article.\n\nTo learn more about referral programs and how to get your program up and running, check out our [Referral Program 101](/success/intro/) article.\n\n"

Our Security Management System automatically protects your referral program against unwanted activity. Our system actively monitors all incoming referrals and analyses them against a range of criteria to check for potentially fraudulent activity. Along with this intelligent referral moderation, you have the ability to change a wide range of settings allowing you to customize how you want your referral program to work. \n### What does our Security Management System detect?\nOur Security Management System employs advanced algorithms to check incoming referrals for similarities in: \n- Name\n- Email address\n- IP address\n- Rate of referrals \n\n### How do I use it?\nYou referral program’s default referral moderation settings will check for fraudulent activity, highlight that activity to you on the Security page in the portal, but take no direct action. You can then choose whether or not you would like to allow our advanced fraud management system to act on potentially fraudulent referrals.\n\nFor a simple and secure referral program select the option to have referrals that have been flagged as potentially fraudulent set to pending.

Programs launched before the update to the Analytics platform on July 13th 2016 will only display data from that point onwards. \n\n#### Analytics and Program Security\nPlease keep in mind that our Analytics platform will only take into account the first state of the referral once it has passed through security moderation. Only referrals that are approved at the end of the moderation process will be counted. For example, if a referral is first denied but later approved, this referral will not be counted as “successful”. \n\nIf you have any questions in regards to using the Security feature in combination with the new analytics, please don’t hesitate to reach out to your Customer Success team or shoot our friendly support staff an email. \n\n#### Additional Questions\nRunning into any issues or have any questions?

                "en-US": "The focus of this SaaS referral program guide is on making use of an “API-only” Referral SaaSquatch program including the use of our squatch.js library and either Dollar Credit or Percent Discount rewards. \n\nInformation on our payment provider integrations (eg. [Stripe](/developer/stripe) and [Recurly](/developer/recurly)) can be found in our docs.\n\nThis Program Outline is based around the same core topics found in the [How Referral SaaSquatch Works](/success/core-topics) article found in our Success Center. \n\nA high level look at referral programs for SaaS business can be found back in the [SaaS Referral program Guide Intro](/guides/saas-intro).\n\nFurther details, including code examples, on how to integrate this referral program into your product can be found in the companion [Installation Guide](/guides/saas-installation) in our technical documentation. \n### Engagement\nExisting customers can enroll in the referral program in two different ways:\n\n- Referral Widget on the website behind a login **[Desktop & Mobile]**\n  \n  Placing the Referral Widget behind a login will allow your existing customers to interact with the referral program. Use the [Squatch JS library](/squatchjs/) to load the Referral Widget. \n\n- Broadcast email to notify existing customers of the program. Provide Referral SaaSquatch with a list of users you would like to enroll in the Referral Program. Referral SaaSquatch registers these users and provides an CSV export file with each user’s unique sharelinks. This CSV file can be imported into an email platform, like Mailchimp, to inform your users about the referral program and provide them with their unique sharelink. Please contact [support](mailto:support@referralsaasquatch.com) to find out the required format for the CSV user data you would like to import.\n\nThe above steps will allow the customers to refer their friends by sharing their unique share link. \n### Identification & Attribution \nWhen a friend clicks on the unique share link we can redirect them to the landing page for your referral program. This can be a dedicated page or simply your website’s homepage. On iOS or Android we can redirect them, using our [Branch integration](/mobile/branch-metrics/), to the app store to install your app. \n\nAfter the referred user fills out the signup form, identify this referred user to Referral SaaSquatch using one of these methods:\n\n- Load the [Squatch JS init](/squatchjs/) call on the page **[Desktop]**\n\n  This code snippet will identify the user to SaaSquatch. This call will also automatically check for a referral cookie with the referrer’s referral code. This automatically takes care of creating the referral connection. (Attribution)\n\n- Use the SaaSquatch [REST API](/api) to [Create the Account](/api/methods/#account_sync) & [Create the User](/api/methods/#create_user) **[Desktop & Mobile]**\n  \n  When using the API, the referral connection (Attribution) has to happen by capturing the referral code from the referral cookie and include it when creating the Account. The [Squatch JS autofill function](/squatchjs/#autofill) can help facilitate this. \n\n- Load the [Mobile Widget](/mobile/widget/) or use the [Mobile SDK](/mobile/) inside the mobile app **[Mobile]**\n\n  The Mobile Widget and Mobile SDK register new participants and show the referral widget to allow users to make referrals. The [Branch integration](/mobile/branch-metrics/) stores the referral code of the person who referred them to easily build the [referral connection](/success/core-topics/#Attribution). \n  \n### Conversion\nOnce the referred user hits the goalpost, Referral SaaSquatch should be informed so we can mark this referral as complete in our system and generate a reward for the referrer. \n\nThis step can be done in three different ways:\n- Manually through the Referral SaaSquatch Portal by looking up the user and changing their status\n- Using the [Squatch JS init](/squatchjs/) call and adding the `'account_status': 'PAID'` parameter\n- Through the REST API by [updating the Account](/api/methods/#account_sync) and setting the status to `PAID`.\n\n### Fulfillment\nSince we are running a double sided referral program we need to fulfill the rewards for both the referrer and the referred user. \n\nWhenever a reward is created by the Referral SaaSquatch system there is a [webhook event](/api/webhooks/) generated. You can [subscribe to these webhooks](http://docs.referralsaasquatch.com/api/methods/#create_webhook) and listen for the `reward.created` event to know when to go about rewarding your users. \n\nThe rewards for both parties will be as following: \n\n- **Referred User**\n  \n  This reward is generated when a Referred User signs up through your platform and you identify them to us. The webhook event `reward.created` has a `rewardSource` parameter that will says `“REFERRED”`. Use this webhook event to kick off reward fulfillment inside your payment system. \n\n- **Referrer**\n  \n  When the referred user’s account status was updated (see [Conversion](#Conversion) step), we mark the referral as successful and generate a reward. The webhook event `reward.created` has a `rewardSource` parameter that will say `“FRIEND_SIGNUP”`. Use this webhook event to kick off reward fulfillment inside your payment system. \n\nAfter fulfilling each reward, make sure to mark these rewards as redeemed using the [Redeem a Single Reward](/api/methods/#debit_reward) API call. This will make sure that the user’s reward progress is updated inside the [Referral Widget](/themes/standard/). \n### Next Steps\nThe companion [installation guide](/guides/saas-installation) for this overview can be found in our technical docs.\n\n### Additional Information\nThe information above provides an overview showing how each of the individual components of a referral program tie together to create a full referral loop.  \n\nMore information on [How Referral SaaSquatch Works](/success/core-topics), as well as our Getting Started [Referral Program 101](/success/intro/) Guide can be found in our Success Center.\n\nIf you have any further questions about information in this guide please don’t hesitate to contact our [support team](mailto:support@referralsaasauqtch.com)."

It is one of the 5 core terms you should know for your referral program. When you run a referral program you often want to separate the linking of referrals from the process of giving people rewards. For example you want to *attribute* a referral as soon as some one signs in to your website,  but you only want to give a referral reward when the referred person [converts](/topics/conversion) and pays their first bill."

Share links are unique links generated for each user that can be used for making referrals.\nShare links rely on [Tracking Cookies](/topics/tracking-cookies) to track when someone has been referred, redirecting referred friends to a website or landing page to get started as a new customers. Share links are\noften used along with [Squatch.js Javascript Library](/squatchjs) or deeplinking like Branch Metrics integration to track when someone has made a successful referral.\n\n**Benefits of Share Links**:\n\n - Work across email, facebook, twitter and other social channels\n - Easy to set up\n - Can have a white-labeled domain\n\n**Disadvantages of Share Links**:\n \n - Relies on Cookies or Deeplinking\n   - Can be blocked by some browsers or cleared regularly\n   - Requires a Deeplinking tool like Branch to work well in Mobile apps\n - Does not support real world face-to-face referrals\n\n<div class=\"text-center\">![Example share link](/assets/images/attribution/sharelink-attribution.png)</div>\n\n\n\n### Referral Codes\n\nReferral codes are a more modern way of sharing that rely on a human-readable code like `BOBTESTERSON`. Referral codes are unique codes that people can use when they sign up for a product\nor check out at a store. Since there is a unique referral code for everyone who shares, referral codes can be used as the sole way of doing attribution. \n\n__Benefits of Referral Codes__:\n\n - Can be used with on-the-phone and in-person sign up processes link Banks, Call Centers and Retail Stores\n - Works well with printed materials\n - Supports mobile-first referrals for native mobile apps\n\n__Disadvantages of Referral Codes__:\n \n - Some companies have policies against allowing any sort of promo codes\n - Can be listed on coupon sites\n\n<div class=\"text-center\">![Example share link](/assets/images/attribution/referralcode-attribution.png)</div>\n\n\n### Hybrid (recommended)\n\nIt is possible to get the best of both worlds by using both human-readable codes and share links. This is the recommended approach for attribution because it provides all of the benefits\nof both of the methods of share links and codes. In most cases, if it's possible to refer friends using a referral code, then it is preferable to go for a hybrid approach and take\nadvantage of the additional analytics provided by links.\n\n__Benefits of Share Links__:\n\n - All of the benefits listed above\n - Best in class success rates\n\n__Disadvantages of Share Links__:\n \n - Some companies have policies against allowing any sort of promo codes\n\n<div class=\"text-center\">![Example share link](/assets/images/attribution/hybrid-attribution.png)</div>\n\n\n### Choosing an attribution method\n\nReferral SaaSquatch has flexible attribution methods for controlling how referrals can be made and tracked. Each attribution method has certain strengths and limitations. Unique share links, for example, are a simple way to power your referral program but they don't work well offline, with cookie blockers or on mobile. Referral codes work well on mobile, but aren't as \nconvenient for online sharing.\n\n<table class=\"table\">\n<tr>\n    <td></td>\n    <td>Desktop</td>\n    <td>Mobile</td>\n    <td>Offline</td>\n<tr>\n<tr>\n    <th>Share Links</th>\n    <td><i class=\"fa fa-check-circle fa-3x\"></i></td>\n    <td><i class=\"fa fa-check-circle fa-3x\" style=\"color: #CCC\"></i></td>\n    <td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n    <th>Referral Codes</th>\n    <td><i class=\"fa fa-check-circle fa-3x\" style=\"color: #CCC\"></i></td>\n    <td><i class=\"fa fa-check-circle fa-3x\"></i></td>\n    <td><i class=\"fa fa-check-circle fa-3x\"></i></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n    <th>Hybrid (Recommended)</th>\n    <td><i class=\"fa fa-check-circle fa-3x\"></i></td>\n    <td><i class=\"fa fa-check-circle fa-3x\"></i></td>\n    <td><i class=\"fa fa-check-circle fa-3x\"></i></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n<div class=\"bs-callout bs-callout-default\">\n  Attribution can use share links, referral codes or both (hybrid)\n</div>\n\n\n### Tech Guide\n\nFor details on implementing attribution, see our [developer center guide on attribution](/developer/attribution)"

For the example parameters from the previous section, this will look like:\n```nohighlight\nhttps://app.referralsaasquatch.com/a/test_345gh4545g23kj3/widgets/mobilewidget?userId=123&firstName=Bob&lastName=Testserson&accountId=abc&paymentProviderId=NULL&email=misterd%2Bmuser001%40example.com&checksum=1KOCYrvKuQWKeyEUmoWCMaY8pmQCPNs%2Ft3a%2BZT0SLAM%3D\n```\n\n### Embedding the URL in a WebView or iFrame\n\nThe unique URL can then be used to show the referral widget to your users.\n\nDetails about how to include a URL in a WebView or iFrame can be found through the following external references for a wide range of mobile development platforms.\n\n - [Android Webview](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebView.html)\n - [iOS Webview](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIWebView_Class/)\n - [Xamarin Webview](http://developer.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/xamarin-forms/working-with/webview/)\n - [Cordova Webview](http://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/5.0.0/guide_hybrid_webviews_index.md.html#Embedding%20WebViews)\n - [Windows Phone Webview](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/windows.ui.xaml.controls.webview.aspx)\n\n### Widget Theme Customization\n\nMobile widgets take full advantage of the Referral SaaSquatch [theme system](/themes/), so they can be completely customized to match\nyour brand, theme, style, colors, fonts, animations and more. By default, [standard themes](/themes/standard/) come with a mobile-responsive template based upon Bootstrap 3, \nbut [custom themes](/themes/custom/) like those used in the Shoeboxed referral program shown here can be customized complete with tabbed navigation.\n\n### Configuring Default mailto Behavior\n\nThe Email Share option in the referral widget uses the `mailto` link format. In order for the mailto link to work smoothly on both iOS and Android devices your app needs to be correctly configured to support the mailto event inside the app.\n\n#### Configure iOS mailto Links\n\nAdd the following code in your UIWebView’s delegate:\n\n```swift\nfunc webView(webView: UIWebView, shouldStartLoadWithRequest r: NSURLRequest, navigationType nt: UIWebViewNavigationType) -> Bool {\n    if let scheme = r.URL?.scheme where scheme == \"mailto\" {\n        UIApplication.sharedApplication().openURL(r.URL!)\n        return false\n    }\n    return true\n}\n```\n\n#### Configure Android mailto Links\n\nCreate your WebViewClient:\n\n```java\npublic class MyWebViewClient extends WebViewClient {\n\n    @Override\n    public boolean shouldOverrideUrlLoading(WebView view, String url) {\n       if(url.startsWith(\"mailto:\")) {\n    \n           String stringUri = null;\n           try {\n               stringUri = URLDecoder.decode(url, \"UTF-8\");\n           } catch (UnsupportedEncodingException e) {\n               e.printStackTrace();\n           }\n    \n           String[] url_variables = stringUri.split(\"&\");\n           String subject = url_variables[0].replaceFirst(\"mailto:\\\\?subject=\", \"\");\n           String body = url_variables[1].replaceFirst(\"body=\", \"\");\n           Intent intent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_SEND);\n           intent.setType(\"message/rfc822\");\n           intent.putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_SUBJECT, subject);\n           intent.putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_TEXT, body);\n    \n           startActivity(Intent.createChooser(intent, \"Send Email\"));\n       }\n       else if(url.startsWith(\"http:\") || url.startsWith(\"https:\")) {\n           view.loadUrl(url);\n       }\n       return true;\n   }\n}\n```\n\nUse the following code example to Load the Webview:\n\n```java\nString url = \"https://app.referralsaasquatch.com/widgeturl\";\nWebView widget = (WebView) this.findViewById(R.id.webView);\nwidget.getSettings().setJavaScriptEnabled(true);\nwidget.setWebViewClient(new MyWebViewClient());\nwidget.loadUrl(url);\n```"
